# Mitra

This is a personal app packed with features to do stuff... mostly to learn stuff.
Mainly to watch shows and anime streaming (via torrent), and also a calendar for scheduling.
This app comes with a server backend component system that sends notifications via telegram as well

To-do
- Finish up the anime viewing section
- A block-style note editor (using editorjs)
- Outfit the backend with a Chatbot for telegram
- Theming, sprucing up
