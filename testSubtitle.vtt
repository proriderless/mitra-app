00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle
Thought you'd come again, sosu.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.320 align:middle
Got it, sosu.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle
That nice-smelling Hollow child has been taken, sosu?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle
And so you need part of Faputa?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle
Reg, if you fulfill our promise, 
then Faputa is Reg's, sosu.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle
Take any part of body you want, sosu.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle
Wh-What did you say?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle
What "promise" are you talking about?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle
You don't remember any of it, sosu?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle
It's something Faputa can only ask of Reg.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle
Reg...

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle
That face swimming around in my memory...

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle
It must have something to do with this promise.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle
Faputa, can you tell me what the promise is just one more time?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle
If it's something only I can do, 
I'd like to see it through.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle
I don't want to force you to make a sacrifice.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle
But instead,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle
can you lend us some of your know... ledge?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle
No need for that, sosu.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle
Wh-What are you...

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle
All of Faputa is fair trade for the promise, sosu.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle
Come now, we will eradicate them together, sosu.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle
I wonder why we ever came to a place like this.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle
I wonder why things ever ended up like this.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle
No one can give us answers to those questions.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle
That is because we are here as a result of choices we ourselves made.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle
We alone have to find those answers.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle
It's all good.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle
I gave everybody else some, too.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle
No matter

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle
what those answers turn out to be.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle


00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle


00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle
of the Scorching Sun

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle
When the song ceases,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle

Please, Belaf...

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle
Please... stop.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle
I couldn't resist.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle
Even though I was sure of what it was.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle

Your eyes!

Oh, you're up.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.030 align:middle
Wazukyan!

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle
B-Belaf is...

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle
Just look!

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle
Belaf will be all right.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle
Don't underestimate us Sages.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle
Just look!

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle
Vueko.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle
I'm gonna go see Irumyuui. Wanna come along?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle
That girl keeps getting bigger day by day.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle
The children she births are about
yea big. They're an armful, literally.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle
She's given birth every day, 
even while you were sleeping.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle
Irumyuui!

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle
Your mommy's here.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle
Irumyuui had already lost her ability to speak.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle
Even so, despite them only living for a day,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle
she lovingly, oh-so-lovingly,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle
embraced the babies she kept on giving birth to.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle
I beg you, Wazukyan! Please let them be together!

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle
At least... at least while the baby's still alive.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle
I really wish I could.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle
But while you were sleeping, 
there just wasn't enough to go around,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle
so I used the living ones, too.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle
Then the symptoms from the pseudo-water started to diminish.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle
Seems to me the degree of freshness matters.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle
Wishes dwell within life, after all.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle
It's a thing of beauty, isn't it?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle
Just look at this sheen.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle
I don't waste a single bit, you know.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle
Wanna give the cooking a try?

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle
Careful now, okay?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle
You're still recovering, after all.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle
I'm sorry, Irumyuui.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle
I...

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle
stood by and let your precious babies die.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle
Why?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle
Why do I not just go insane?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle
Forgive me, Irumyuui.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle
I'm so weak, and I c-couldn't choose...

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle
between you and the people who gave me a place in life.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle
B-But...

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle
standing by and watching as your wish continues to get taken from you...

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle
I-I just can't do it!

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle
I'll go...

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle
with you...

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle
Your heartbeat...

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle
If... living in this state is what you wished for...

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle
If you still have wishes that you would pursue even now...

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle
I-I fear I might...

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle
I might trample over them again.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle
What in the world should I do?

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle
You're here, Vueko, so it's fine.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle
I-Iru...

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle
Wh-What should I do?

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle
Unable to go insane, unable to simply die,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle
I couldn't make even a single choice.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle
Although I longed to be punished, I could think of no greater punishment than this.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle
It was Hell.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle
I beg of you...

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle
Please stop.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:38.410 align:middle
For some reason, I can't resist that stuff... 
which makes this all the harder to bear.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle
Please...

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle
I can't...

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle
No more...

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle
Even in Hell, people keep on living.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle
And that is why...

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle
we have prayers and lies.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle
By the time everyone got used to Hell, 
Irumyuui had stopped her shrieking.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle
The scar left by the egg?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle
There's something deep inside the hole?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle
It's... the Cradle of Desire?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle
Didn't it shatter?

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle
That's the second one.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle
When you fell ill, Irumyuui grew weak too,
as if she was responding to you.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle
W-Whuh?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle
So I tried giving her another one.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle
What are you saying?

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle
There're more of these things, you know?

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle
After all, the Interference Units seemed to have seen one before.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle
So I had them look for some.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle
We made it in time, thank goodness.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle
I-Is...

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle
Is this really what Irumyuui wished for?
I mean, just look at her!

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle
I-Irumyuui! What's the matter?!

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle
She's sympathizing with you.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle
The time has come.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle
Let's go and see her true wish

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle
with our own eyes.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle
Wh-Where are you going?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle
N-No! Eilu!

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle
If we head outside of camp like this, i-it's all over!

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle
Damn...

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle
Everyone, stay close to Irumyuui!

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle
Try not to get caught up in the fray!

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle
L-Leave me behind...

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle
I can't...

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle
Nope. You're indispensable.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle
You were too noble to ever get used to the suffering.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle
None of the rest of us will do.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle
Sh-She stopped.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle
What's going on?

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle
Hey, Interference Unit, 
any idea what's in this place?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle
Nothing. It is a hidden spot. 
It is very close to the center of the pit.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle
I see. So the shade was the problem, huh?

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle
Irumyuui, what's wrong?

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle
What?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle
What's happening?

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle
She's absorbing the creatures?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle
She's luring them in and eating them. 
Looks like it's still not nearly enough for her.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle
I beg you...

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle
P-Please...

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle
consume me.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle
I-I prolonged my life
by taking what is dear to you.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle
I've toughed out starvation and pain before... b-but I couldn't resist.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle
My pride... my c-convictions... are all gone.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle
I-I...

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle
can't stay human any longer.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle
I-I beg of you...

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle
please... punish me.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle
My bones, my soul, every single part of me!

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.380 align:middle
Devour it all!

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle
Belaf!

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle
Belaf has taken a new form!

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle
How beautiful.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle
Thank you, Belaf.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle
I'm glad we made it in time.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle
Come now, let us offer up our bodies and souls to our Queen.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle
This is the homeland.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle
More valuable than gold could ever be.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle
Unobtainable no matter how much we sought it.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle
It is our home.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle
Vueko?

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle
I don't want this.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle
I just can't believe this is really what Irumyuui wished for.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle
D-Don't you think the second egg did this to her?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle
Vueko, what is it you wanna do, then?

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle
I-I...

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.750 align:middle
I... should've done this sooner.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle
Vueko.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle
Without you, Irumyuui's wish will no longer be fulfilled.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle
Poor Irumyuui.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle
She'd most likely be sad, 
grow weak, and end up dying.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle
So then... if I die, will your prophecy fail?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle
I'm sorry, Irumyuui...

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle
for being so selfish.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle
That warm darkness is mine alone.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle
I won't let anyone else have it.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle
Symptoms of the pseudo-water!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle
Wait, no!

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle
He's...

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle
gone and used...

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle
a Cradle on him—

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle
No one can take her away from you.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle
Irumyuui is yours alone.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle
Whuh?

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle
What? Where am I?

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle
You're inside Irumyuui's head.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle
This is where you can have the deepest connection to her.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle
Wazukyan?

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle
Yay! Think it suits me?

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle
A Cradle of Desire...

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle
You used one too, huh?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle
Yep.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle
I already gave my body over to Irumyuui, 
though, so this is just the remnants.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle
But how?

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle
I mean, the Interference Units warned us. 
They said adults shouldn't use them.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle
Vueko.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle
You all might call me "divinely possessed,"

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle
but I've still gotta do everything I can.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle
You've witnessed it, right?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle
If you were this cursed pit,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle
what would you do for those who came here and did nothing but pray?

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle
Vueko.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle
I know the truth.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.610 align:middle
We've been gathered here.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle
That compass you brought with you...

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.340 align:middle
I don't know why, but I felt homesick the moment I saw it.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle
Whuh?

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle
Even though we were forsaken by our homelands?

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle
The "homesickness" I felt doesn't come from having feelings for your homeland.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle
Something you can't have, 
no matter how much you yearn for it.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle
Something that will never come back.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle
Something that will never exist anywhere again...

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle
It's a fragile but deep—so very deep—
longing for such a thing.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle
"Homesickness."

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle
For me, that something was Irumyuui.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle
Yeah.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle
I'm sure the great pit will continue to call out, 
hereafter and far into the future,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle
to those who keep striving to fulfill their longing.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle
What are you talking about? Is that a prophecy?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle
More like a hope.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle
I'll be going now.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle
Please watch over things from in here, 
where Irumyuui's feelings reach you directly.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle
This place is already yours alone.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle
In the darkness, I could sense faint signals.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle
Everyone had Irumyuui swallow their flesh and souls

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle
and became a part of her.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle
Irumyuui had already lost her human intellect,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle
but she kept on living with one, 
and only one, purpose.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle
She consumed everyone and sucked up the power of the Golden City.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle
Wazukyan!

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle
The second egg is...

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle
Well, I didn't see this coming.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle
So that no one would notice, 
you secretly, oh-so-secretly,

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle
attempted to fulfill your one and only wish.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle
The thing you yearned for but
couldn't have—your "homesickness."

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle
A longing too fragile, a longing too deep...

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle
Your...

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle
Your final child.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle
Ah... I was so glad.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle
Irumyuui...

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle
you didn't...

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle
didn't forgive a single thing.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle
You couldn't forgive any of this.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle
You bottled it all up and were screaming inside, weren't you?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle
I couldn't see what your child looked like, but I could hear her voice.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle
The voice of her countless siblings' dismay.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle
The voice of your imprisoned soul—of your flesh,
which we'd made into our home.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle
She was screaming it out with her whole being.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle
Irumyuui, until I met you, there was something I'd been looking for.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle
But, I didn't need to find it anymore.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle
I loved the warm darkness.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle
At the end of my homesickness, I found something that was never going to come back.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle
Within the true darkness, there certainly was a light that no one could find.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle
But not a single person could take hold of it—

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle
that solitary princess born from the darkness.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle
I couldn't help but hope

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle
that you'd be able to fulfill the wish you inherited from your mother.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle
And that someday the curse would be lifted,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle
and you could find your very own wish and set out on a joyful journey.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle
A feeble signal informs me

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle
that these beings are the children who have returned,

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle
Pienta...

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle
Tsunafe...

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle
and the children who were still to be born.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle
Kopuro...

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle
They are the children Irumyuui never got to call by name.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle
The shapes of their souls.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle
You're a little one, aren't you? 
I'll call you "Kati," then.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle
It's all right.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle
No matter how many times it takes, 
I vow to give each of you a name.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.500 align:middle
You're a bit warm, aren't you?

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle
"Tikmo" it is, then.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle
If you can't sleep, I'll sing you lullabies, okay?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.140 align:middle
In place of your mother, who can no longer speak.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle
No matter how many times... 
No matter how many times...

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle
You're worried about your youngest sister, aren't you?

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle
Garafa...

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle
Children of gentle Irumyuui...

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle
Togii...

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle
when you're so worried you can't sleep,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle
Tepka...

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle
I'll sing you lullabies.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle
Io...

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle
No matter how many times, I'll call your names.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle
So that I won't forget them.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle
No matter how many times...

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle
No matter how many times...

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle
Normally, Irumyuui wouldn't have the strength left to even maintain the village

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle
because Faputa inherited the three eggs.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle
But the activity here and all the visitors...

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle
Value beyond imagination keeps Irumyuui alive.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle
Right now, this village is much bigger and more robust than it used to be.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle
Vueko, what does Faputa intend to do?

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle
Free her mother.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle
She's going to destroy this village.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle
Because of her nature, she can't pass through the membrane into the village,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle
but it seems she's been trying to find a way in this whole time.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle
Um...

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle
Isn't there any way you can reason with her?

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle
Riko, this is just a what-if,

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle
but suppose an old lady you've never seen before told you to stop adventuring. Would you?

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle
No way!

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle
Um, so in short... that's how it is with Faputa.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle
Well, the Princess's wish is Irumyuui's wish, after all.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle
I couldn't even try and stop her, you know?

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle
Hey, Vueko, what...

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle
What do you yourself want to do?

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle
I...

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle
I only want one thing now.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle
I just

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle
don't want to forget about her.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle


00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle


00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle
I still remember you

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle
I still remember you

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle
I still remember you

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle
The time we shared

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle
The time we shared

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle
The time we shared

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle
The love you gave

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle
The love you gave

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle
The love you gave

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle
Though everything has changed

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle
Though everything has changed

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle
Though everything has changed

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle
You push me to live on

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle
You push me to live on

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle
You push me to live on

00:23:50.230 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle
From a place even deeper than the seabed, I'm still watching over you

00:23:50.230 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle
From a place even deeper than the seabed, I'm still watching over you

00:23:50.230 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle
From a place even deeper than the seabed, I'm still watching over you

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle
But our futures have been pulled apart

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle
But our futures have been pulled apart

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle
But our futures have been pulled apart

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle
I still love you, even though I miss you

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle
I still love you, even though I miss you

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle
I still love you, even though I miss you

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle
Through this endless night of woe

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle
Through this endless night of woe

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle
Through this endless night of woe

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle
Love still lives

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle
Love still lives

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle
Love still lives

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle
I will be here for you, always and forever

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle
I will be here for you, always and forever

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle
I will be here for you, always and forever

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle
Even now, I'm still praying for you

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle
Even now, I'm still praying for you

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle
Even now, I'm still praying for you

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle
In the dark's warm embrace

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle
In the dark's warm embrace

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle
In the dark's warm embrace

00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle
