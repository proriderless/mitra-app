00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.400 align:middle
Take this!

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.160 align:middle
Why me?!

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.820 align:middle
Gotcha!

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.380 align:middle
M-Miyo-chan!

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.400 align:middle
You guys were wide open!

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.320 align:middle
H-How could this happen?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle
How could such a wonderful 
night turn out this way?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle
ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle

ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle
Winter break rules!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle
After many trials and tribulations, 
through thick and thin,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle
#08  Mahiro's First Girls Sleepover

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle
I've finally reached paradise.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle
Now I can slack off to my heart's content!

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle
I knew long breaks from 
school would pose an issue.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle
He'll be back to his old 
ways if I don't step in.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle
I've got it!

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle

Kaede Hozuki

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
Kaede

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
You're welcome.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
Thank you so much!

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
Don't mention it.
Well, I'm gonna\Nhead to bed now.\NGoodnight!

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
Goodnight!

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
Onii-chan | I'm | Kaede | Okay

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle
Can Momiji-chan and

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle
Can Momiji-chan and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle
Can Momiji-chan and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle
All right!

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle
Break won't last forever, so 
I'd better make the best of it.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle
Okay.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle
Time to plan out my schedule with a graph.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle
I'll wanna sleep in late in the mornings,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle
and have plenty of chill time 
in the evenings, too.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle
So with that in mind...

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle
Anime

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle
Sleep

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle
Eat

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle
Video 
Games

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle
Eat

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle
Manga

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle
I-It's perfect.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle
Well, without further ado!

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle
It's time to play nothing but video 
games from now until dinner!

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle
That's no different from 
what you normally do.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle
It is the will of Gaia that 
I indulge in this way.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle
It shall be named my Winter Vacation Mode!

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle
Honestly...

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle
M-Mihari?

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle
You wanna play with me?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle
Not today.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle
Oh, that must be them!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle
There's funny business afoot.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle
Thanks for having us!

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle
Wassup?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle
Hey there!

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle
It's an ambush!

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle
Y-You plan on dragging me 
outside again, don't you?!

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle
I won't go along with it this time, okay?!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle
But I thought we were 
having a sleepover today.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle
Weren't you the one who 
suggested it, Mahiro-chan?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle
We're coming in!

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle
A... sleepover?

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.030 align:middle
Wh-When did I say—

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle
I brought my PJs and everything!

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle
I brought mine too.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle
Same here!

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle
Oh?

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle
Were you playing a game, Mahiro-chan?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.800 align:middle
Ooo!

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle
Can we play too, Mahiron?! Can we?!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle
Yeah, of course!

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle
Oh, but this is only a two-player game...

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle
Ta-da!

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle
And now...

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle
Your big sis comes to 
the rescue with a gift!

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle
Kozy Kart

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle
Whoa!

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle
You go, Mihari!

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle
Whoa, that was close!

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle
Oh yeah, it's bomb time!

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle
I can just dodge it, you know?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle
Oh, no! I'm gonna get hit!

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle
Go, go, go!

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle
Dinner's ready!

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle
Coming!

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle
Onimai.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle
Thanks for dinner!

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle
You're such a good cook, Doc!

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle
I told you I'm not a doctor.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle
All right, bring by your empty plates.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle
You heard her, Mahiron.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle
You lost, remember?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle
Too bad you were the one who 
suggested these stakes.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle
Come on, I let them win.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle
They're our guests, after all.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle
You seem pretty devastated for 
someone who lost on purpose.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle
See? Aren't games more 
enjoyable with friends?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle
Let's play that game again sometime.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle
Th-That... depends on the game.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle
Yeah!

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle
It was fun, wasn't it?

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle
I wanna play again.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle
You could just admit it, you know?

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle
Admit what?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle
I'm done...

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle
Nice work!

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle
Good job!

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle
So do you wanna keep playing?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle
It's getting late. We'd 
bother the neighbors, no?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle
I worked up a sweat too, so I 
kinda wanna take a bath now.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle
Actually, same.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle
Hmm...

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle
Well, I don't mind going last, 
so why don't you guys—

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle
Let's go in pairs!

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle
If we go in one at a time, the 
water'll get cold before we're done.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle
Th-That's a big no-no!

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle
Why's that?

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle
I-It's just... Um...

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle
Come on, Mahiron! I can 
wash your back for you!

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle
I-In that case, I can wash 
your hair for you too!

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle
Uh...

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle
Um...

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle
Come on, you two. Settle down.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle
Miyo-chan!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle
How about the OG AsaMomi pairing?

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle
Asa?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle
Momi?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle
It's no use! She's been corrupted!

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle
You mean Asahi and I should 
battle each other for it?

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle
Oh! You wanna go?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle
All right!

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle
Let's rock-paper-scissors!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle
Hell yeah! I'm going with rock!

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle
Hold it, hold it!

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle
I-I-I'm gonna...

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle
What the—?!

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle
We're getting in together. 
This is your own fault.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle
H-Huh?!

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle
U-Um...

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle
I don't know how I feel about 
you seeing me this close up...

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle
You've gotten bigger, huh?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.050 align:middle
Wha?! That's sexual harassment!

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle
That's not what I meant!

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle
We used to bathe together when 
we were little, remember?

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle
I was just reminiscing.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle
Well, you've gotten smaller.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle
And whose fault is that?!

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle
The bath is free! You guys can go now!

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle
Wow!

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle
You're so cute, Mahiro-chan!

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle
You smell good too, Mahiron!

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle
Wha?

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle
You're just smelling the shampoo!

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle
Come on, Asahi! It's time for our bath!

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle
Uwaraba!

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle
You too, Miyo-chan!

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle
B-But it'll be too cramped 
with the three of us.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle
Come on, it's a sleepover. We might as well!

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle
You can wash up first, Miyo-chan.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle
Me and Momiji will go 
ahead and get in the tub.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle
O-Okay...

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle
This is like my worst nightmare!

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle
Though getting to see my pairing 
interact up close is a treat.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle
Blub, blub, blub, blub.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle
Take this!

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle
It's been so long since we've 
bathed together, huh, Asahi?

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle
Do you remember?

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle
Hm?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle
Back when we first became friends.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle
My name's Asahi!

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle
I'm Momiji. Nice to meet you!

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle
It's a topknot! You're a samurai!

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle
Nice to meet you, Momijiro!

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle
Mo-mi-ji!

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.360 align:middle
That's so cool! I wish I had a topknot!

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle
Maybe I should put my hair up too.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle
You're so weird.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle
Here, I have an idea.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle
See? Pretty cute, huh?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle
Hup!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle
Take that!

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle
Yay!

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle
Wanna take a bath?

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle
Sure!

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle
Is it okay if we go in together?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle
Oh! Did you not want to?

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle
N-No, it's okay.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle
I bathe with my big brother all the time.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle
Is yours gonna grow in later?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle
What?

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle
I know we were little, but 
that was still pretty rude.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle
My goodness.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle
We used to wash each other too, huh?

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle
May I request a reenactment?!

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle
All right, then, Miyo-chin.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle
C'mere and I'll wash you.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle
I-I didn't mean me...

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle
Come on, now! Don't be shy!

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle
That actually feels kinda nice...

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle
I used to wash my brother's 
back all the time, you know?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle
Okay, now reach for the sky!

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle
Gotta get your underarms!

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle
I wasn't expecting that.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle
Onimai.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle
Onimai.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle
Mahiro

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.050 align:middle
You really think we should be 
sleeping in the same room?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle
That's the whole point of a 
sleepover, don't you think?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle
Or would you rather sleep 
with your big sister too?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle
I said I'm sorry about the bath thing, okay?

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle
I know for a fact you're 
harmless, after all.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle
You say that like I'm some wild animal.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle
Futons!

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle
This is so exciting!

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle
Asahi! You're in the way!

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle
Was it cramped, being 
in the bath together?

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle
It was totally fine!

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle
Th-Though we did have a small incident...

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle
Wow!

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle
You look so grown-up, Miyo-chan!

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle
I'm an observer, not a participant, okay?!

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle
Just try and give her a little space.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.390 align:middle
What the hell happened in that bath?

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle
Well, you're all set, so have fun.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle
Don't stay up all night, okay?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle
See ya later, Doc!

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle
Goodnight!

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle
Okay, what now? What are we doing?!

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle
Whoa, there!

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle
Let's decide who's sleeping where first.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle
I'll sleep here.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle
This one's mine, anyway.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle
Then I'll take the one next to hers!

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle
No fair!

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle
Let's rock-paper-scissors for it this time!

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle
Hell yeah! I'm going with scissors!

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle
It's Asahi. I should have 
known I was overthinking it.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle
Honesty wins again!

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle
Be careful, Mahiro-chan.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle
Asahi's a nightmare to sleep next to.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle
Wha? Really? Aw, man...

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle
I'll be good, I promise.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle
Take this!

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle
You little...

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle
You've done it now!

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle
Whoops.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle
Hey...

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle
This isn't a field trip, you know?

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle
That's it!

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle
We got her mad!

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle
Sorry, Mahiro-chan!

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle
Take this! Vanishing pillow!

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle
Keep it down, will you?!

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle
Onimai.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle
This is all your fault, Asahi.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle
You were being loud too, you know?

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle
Let's just try to keep it 
down from now on, okay?

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle
Then...

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle
It's finally time for some girl talk!

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle
Oh, you're back with us, Miyo-chan?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle
Chatting is the best part of a sleepover!

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle
I see.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle
Chatting's not really my thing...

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle
Hey, hey! What do you 
guys wanna talk about?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle
Romance, right? It's gotta be romance.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle
Well then, allow me to take the lead.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle
Huh?!

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle
I'll tell you a fearsome tale...

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle
of the Pillow Flipper spirit!

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle
This is a true story of my 
many encounters with it.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle
Every night, when I'm asleep, 
it appears before my pillow.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle
Pillow, pillow, pillow...

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle
It takes your pillow from under your head,

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle
and even moves you around in your sleep.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle
This is girl talk?

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle
That's just a spooky campfire story.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle
Asahi, you dummy!

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle
Why'd you have to bring 
up such a scary story?!

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle
H-Hey now, weren't you listening?

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle
That wasn't scary at all!

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle
La-la-la! I'm not listening!

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle
I didn't think she'd react this badly...

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle
So you already knew she didn't like them?

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle
That's pretty mean, you know?

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle
I'm going to sleep!

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle
I'm sorry!

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle
Aw! What about our romance talk?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle
Momiji can be pretty cute 
sometimes too, huh?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle
I'm turning off the light now!

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle
Okay!

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle
I really need to go to the bathroom...

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle
This is all Asahi's fault!

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle
I'll just have to hold it in till morning.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle
So cold...

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle
Where'd my comforter go?

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle
She really is a nightmare 
to sleep next to...

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle
It's no use! She's sound asleep!

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle
I'm gonna catch a cold at this rate.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle
I give up.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle
Time for an emergency evac.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle
Momiji...

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper?!

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle
S-Sorry about that. Really.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle
D-Don't beat yourself up about it!

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle
It was my fault, anyway.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle
Just leave the rest to me.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle
You can head back and use 
my futon instead, okay?

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle
O-Okay...

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle
Where will you sleep, though, Mahiro-chan?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle
Hmm...

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle
Oh!

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle
Mihari

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle
Wha?! What's going on?

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle
Why are you here?

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle
Please, no questions at this time.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle
Goodnight!

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle
Wow, this is so embarrassing!

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle
I must have drunk too much 
before bed, you know?

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle
So that's what happened.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle
Well, you live and you learn.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle
You didn't have to take the 
blame for me, you know?

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle
No worries, I got you.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle
It'll be our little secret.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle
Y-You're sure?

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle
Well, thank you.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.190 align:middle
It's no biggie.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle
Interesting. Very interesting.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle
Wait...

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle
Where's Asahi-chan?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle
She's still sleeping upstairs.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle
Asahi's never been much of a morning person.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper strikes again!

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle
See you next time!

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle
