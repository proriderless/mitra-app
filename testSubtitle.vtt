WEBVTT

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle
When the singing stops, it is the end of fate

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle
I had decided only that, I don't know the reason

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle
Although I'm yearning for it so much even the gold color fades

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle
It seems the outline of longing becomes more distant

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle
It overflows

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle
Here, my palm

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle
Squeeze it back

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle
Let's exchange pain for pain

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle
We'll turn it into provisions, pieces of fallen petals

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle
Wholly wounded, I imitate, I take shape

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle
Beyond the awakening

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle
Let's go, always, let's make it resound

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle
Village of the Hollows

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle
This is the sixth layer...

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle
Huh? If I ascend, the Curse'll...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.290 align:middle
It's okay, Riko.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle
I don't know why,
but the force field doesn't exist here.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle
So you won't get hit with the Curse.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle
Let's try following them.
I wanna learn the truth about these guys.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle
Yeah.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle
Also, I can't read consciousnesses here
since there's no force field, Reg.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle
I'm counting on you to stay vigilant.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle
Understood.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle
Nanachi, are these guys... Hollows?

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle
Probably.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle
But maybe they've retained their humanity.
They seem oddly intelligent, right?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle
And the body of the one calling themself "Majikaja"...

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle
What in the world is it?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle
We need to know if we're gonna go further...

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle
That's the sense I get.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle
Could it have something to do with

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle
"Curses and Blessings" the
Sovereign of Dawn talked about?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle
Who knows?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle
But I hope this isn't the work of those White Whistles.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle
IMIri... It's here.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle
Prushka!

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle
Y-you little...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle
Reg, wait!

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle
Prushka...

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle
Prushka... doesn't mind it.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle
But why?

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle
Because the stone's not in its true form.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle
MEDIBOO...

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle
What was it in the common language?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle
It gives sound to a life's will...

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle
A musical instrument?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle
That.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle
Upon becoming instruments,
stones get stronger and their precision increases.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle
To possess one without undergoing that process
isn't good for its value.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.830 align:middle
"Value"?

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle
Come with me.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle
Kaja will show you our IRUburu.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle
Hey, Majikaja was it?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle
What in the world are you?

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle
A Hollow, just like that Nice-Smelling Fluffy One.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle
Sorry, but I'm not so sure
you're even a living creature.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle
Kaja's body is made of smells.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle
Kaja can't speak in that form.
This body is a vessel.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle
Kaja wanted a body - not a vessel.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle
Wow!

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle
What is this place? It's just like a market.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle
Yes, a market. A marketplace of value.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle
Things and not-things
can be bartered based on value.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle
"Value"... Kaja said that earlier, too.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle
Well, I bet it means something's worth.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle
The unit of currency? It's not Orth.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle
Look!

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle
These are the belongings of cave raiders!

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle
This one has an antiquated shape...
Must be from a long time ago.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle
I wonder when, exactly.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle
They're all in really good condition.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle
No way. Isn't this...

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.920 align:middle
a section from Mother's letter?!

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle
APPUAAANN!

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle
You must not touch that
which has value without permission.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle
Majikaja, I want that!

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle
Someone like you can buy anything.
Just change into value.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle
It's possible to barter?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle
Th-then, which of my things can I trade?

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle
Let's see...

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle
No, you yourself.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle
You would fetch a very good value.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle
For instance, your eyes, or skin, or fat.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle
Human children have the most value.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle
Kaja also wants one if it's whole.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle
Before you sell to someone else, please...

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle
Wait!

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle
I'm not for sale!

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle
I'm going to the bottom of the netherworld!

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle
What a shame. Kaja'll give up, then.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle
Stealing value is the gravest of crimes.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle
Well, I won't give up.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle
Can I buy it with my hair
or nail clippings or something?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle
Did you two see it? The symbol on the money...

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle
Y-yeah.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle
It's that same symbol.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle
Maybe Majikaja doesn't actually know
about that note, then.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle
Why not try to get info out of them by acting
like we're interested in everything here?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle
After all, the issue of who took Prushka
got sidestepped.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle
Good one, Reg.
Gettin' used to enemy territory now, huh?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle
Reg, Nanachi!

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle
Look at this! Amazing!

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle
They also sell hermit-dwellers!

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle
And they're alive!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle
She's just being herself and enjoying this.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle
How cute.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle
Is this seller offering them as pets?
Or are they for food?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle
Neither... but both.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle
This one, Enbelietz, values having small things
crawl around their body.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle
The excess animals are displayed like this
as value for bartering.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle
Kaja also trades a lot to make vessels.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle
Sabassa over there values passing tubes
through their own body.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle
Miskeso values slicing apart the bodies of others.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle
U-um... they sure look the part, don't they?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle
The bodies of all us Hollows more or less
take on the shape of our respective desires.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle
We all had desires and
challenged the netherworld

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle
but ended up having no place to go
and chose to become Hollows here.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle
When we offer up our lives here and turn into Hollows,
we become bound to this place and cannot leave it.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle
But in exchange, we receive protection
and a body in line with our desires.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle
Nice-Smelling Fluffy One...

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle
Unlike us here, you're a Hollow
from the old ritual site, aren't you?

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle
You have a real life.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle
You must've been protected by a very powerful desire.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle
It is of wonderful value.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle
I see.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle
Just like me, you guys dreamed of the bottom
of the Abyss and set out on an adventure, huh?

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle
I can't stay here, but it's nice to meet you.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle
maaaa!

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle
That's Meinya. Play nice, okay?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle
H-hey, that tickles...

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle
C-come on, stop!

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle
Have a taste of your own medicine.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle
S-stop!
Have a taste of your own medicine.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle
Ah?! Meinya!

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle
No! Don't take Meinya from me!
maaaa!

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle
Let me through!

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle
No! Don't be so rough with Meinya!

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle
maaaa!

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle
maaaa!

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle
Meinya!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle
No... Meinya!

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle
Hey! Move! Outta my way!

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle
maaaa!

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle
Show me.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle
Well... What's with this?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle
The bones are so soft...

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle
Hey... don't struggle.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle
Meinya!

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle
Seems there wasn't anywhere for the air to go,
so the butt guts plopped out.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle
I'll push 'em back in...

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle
but it's gonna be swollen for a while.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle
maaaa!

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle
KEFU... What is its value?

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle
No! Meinya's not that kinda thing!

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle
Is it so high you can't determine it?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle
That's right!

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle
KEFEriKEFU. EVImiHAKU...

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle
Ah... The balancing begins.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle
ma! maaaa!

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle
ma! ma! ma! ma!

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle
ma!

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.580 align:middle
maaaaa!

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle
What... is that?

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle
That one caused damage
to a value that exceeds their own.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle
It must be balanced.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle
Things they saved up. Things they hid.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle
ma!

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle
The balancing will not end
until the values achieve equilibrium.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle
maa! maa!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle
maaaa!

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle
Nanachi, are you okay?

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle
It's nothing...

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.380 align:middle
IRUburu...

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle
The village understands the desires of its inhabitants.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle
An undesired thing that has no buyers
is transformed to a low value.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle
Things that are changed into value are lost forever.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle
Everyone knows that,
so we all abide by the protection.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle
Hey, that... doesn't make me feel any better.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle
Can't you make it stop?

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle
IRUburu...

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle
The protection of the village is so strong
Kaja can't do anything about it.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle
Or is its value so low there was actually
no need for the balancing?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle
It's not that! But...

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle
I just wanted them to be gentle with Meinya!

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle
HADI.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle
maaaa!

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle
The shortfall is made up for with the body.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle
There are lots of buyers for bodies.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle
There are some who value knowing what's inside.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle
Well, if stealing value's a crime,
how do you justify what happened with Prushka?

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle
That stone was brought in from outside of IRUburu.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle
Things that happen outside
aren't protected by the power of the village.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle
Hmm, you're saying you guys
aren't the ones who stole her?

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle
HADImae.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle
What? What?!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle
That's yours.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle
It's finally reached the amount
of your damaged value.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle
Do I... have to take this?

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle
maeN?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle
Even if you throw it away, it won't be discarded.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle
The value is bound to you.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle
With that much, HANIisuku HADI...

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle
How do I put it?

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle
You'll not want for human food
or a place to sleep.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle
HADImae...

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle
Kaja will go pass my body through.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle
See you later.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle
Huh? Wait!

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle
Everyone now knows your value
after what just happened.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle
Kaja thinks no one will come hurt you.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle
HADI.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle
HADI.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle
HADI.
HADI.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle
Um, we're looking for lodging.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle
madimo.
Um, we're looking for lodging.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle
modima.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle
modima.
Do you know a place we could stay?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle
Do you know a place we could stay?

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle
madimo.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle
This is troublesome...

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle
HANIISUKU?

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle
modi...

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle
HANIISUKU...

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle
modi...

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle
HANIISUKU.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle
There's poop down there!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle
HANI?!

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle
KONbosu!

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle
EIbuMENmee.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle
O-oh? They understood?

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle
Riko, how'd you know that?

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle
Earlier, Majikaja said that word when
talking about food and a place to sleep.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle
HANIISUKU.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle
You're pretty amazing.
The language's difficult to decipher...

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle
At times like this,
even if you don't know the language,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle
it's key to keep calm
and make yourself understood.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle
Also, our orphanage does tour guiding, you know!

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle
I wasn't that good at it, though.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle
We witnessed something terrible, but you know...

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle
maybe more than anyone, she understands
we can't let ourselves get down at a time like this.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle
Yeah...

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle
Most likely, she just can't contain her excitement.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle
Um... I'd like to rent a room for me,
Reg, Nanachi, and also Meinya.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle
I don't know how much it is...

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle
And some food, too.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle
I feel bad using this money...

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle
Don't say that.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle
After all, we need a safe place to treat Meinya.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle
So this is the inn!

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle
This's... the toilet?

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle
This is... food?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle
What? It's not half bad, you know.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle
You're right!

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle
Hey, given the color of this -
and all the insects swarming on it -

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.330 align:middle
you sure it's okay?

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.330 align:middle
It's fine!

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.830 align:middle
Stuff with a truly irredeemable flavor
like Nanachi's cooking is rare.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle
Besides, I bet we won't be able
to eat this anywhere else.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.830 align:middle
I don't want to miss my chance and regret it.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle
This journey in the Abyss
is a once-in-a-lifetime thing!

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle
Told you so.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle
Need something to warm your tummy?

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle
I'm okay...

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle
With this sort of thing,
it's better to get the runs sooner rather than later.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle
Bathroom!

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle
This is a scene I've seen
countless times at the orphanage.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle
She'll probably spend half the day
glued to the toilet.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle
What do you want to do today?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle
I'll go look for things that should be
good for Meinya and Riko.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle
Wanna come with?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle
What's going on? It's oddly busy.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle
An earthquake... No, what was that impact?

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle
Majikaja!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle
RIE.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle
What in the world is this commotion?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle
HADI...

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle
It must be Faputa. Kaja'll go see, too.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle
Faputa?

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle
Very rare. Always very angry.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle
Faputa, embodiment of value.
But usually doesn't show self.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle
Can go anywhere, and will never perish.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle
Kaja wants to see.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle
Hear that, Reg?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle
Yeah.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle
Faputa can go anywhere, but usually isn't seen...

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle
Probably the one who left that note, huh?

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle
Let's go, Nanachi.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle
W-wait!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle
Leaving an immobile Riko and Meinya behind
in this ruckus makes me uneasy.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle
Can I ask you to do some recon?

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle
Roger.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle
If anything comes up, I'll call on the comm device.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle
Don't let your guard down!
And turn back if you don't know what to do!

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle
Got it!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle
What happened to the human child?

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle
She's got a painful upset stomach.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle
HADIma!

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle
That's no good.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle
Kaja doesn't want the human child's value to fall!

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle
Do you know where they sell clean water and fruit?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle
Kaja'll guide you!

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle
HADIma! But Kaja wants to see Faputa.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle
But...

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle
Which one'll it be?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle
Well, about this Faputa...

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle
What are they like?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle
HADImae... Faputa.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle
The meaning in the common language is...
How do you say it?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle
A high-status... female...

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle
What? She a princess or something?

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle
That's right.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle
Princess...

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle
Princess of the Hollows.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle
GYUII.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle
IUUUU?

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle
WIWIWI.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle
WIWIWII.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle
What?

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle
JUUU...

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle
Are they asking us something?
JUUU...

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle
Are they asking us something?

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle
We are Ganja, a suicide squad
that is in search of the Golden City.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle
GANJUUU.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle
It's Ganja.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle
They're trying to figure out our intentions
based on our reactions...

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle
and likely our speech, too.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle
That's great. Great.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle
I feel their intelligence, ya know?

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle
GANJEE.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle
You think... they want us to follow 'em?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle
Stay on your guard.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle
It's the Golden City.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle
It really exists!

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle
GWOOL. GWOOLDEN.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle
GWOOLDEN CITYY.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle
In that place we finally arrived at
on our long, arduous adventure...

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle
we had still been unable to find a way to survive.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle
I still remember you

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle
The time we shared

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle
The love you gave

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle
Though everything has changed

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle
You push me to live on

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle
I watch over you from the depths deeper than the sea

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle
The future in which we've parted

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle
I still love you, even though I miss you

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle
In the night of sorrow that goes on for eternity

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle
Love lives

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle
I will be here for you, always and forever

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle
Even now I'm always wishing

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle
Within this warm darkness

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle
