00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.670 align:middle
In an era in which the nations of 
the world were waging a fierce war

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle
of information just out of sight,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.620 align:middle
two countries were at odds with 
each other: Ostania, in the east,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.030 align:middle
and Westalis, in the west.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.930 align:middle
In order to keep an eye on the actions of 
a leading figure in Ostania's government

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle
who was planning a war,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle
Westalis set Operation Strix in motion.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle
The one tasked with this operation 
is the skilled agent, Twilight.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle
The mission given to the master of 
disguise with a hundred faces was...

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle
to start a family.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle
The father, Loid Forger, is a psychiatrist.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle
His true identity: a spy.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle
Code name: Twilight.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle
The mother, Yor Forger, is a civil 
servant who works at city hall.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle
Her true identity: an assassin.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle
Code name: Thorn Princess.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle
The daughter, Anya Forger.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle
Her true identity: a telepath 
who can read people's minds.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle
The dog, Bond Forger.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle
His true identity: a canine seer 
who can see the future.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle
They created this pretend 
family for their own benefit,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle
and their mission continues as they all 
hide their identities from each other.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle
Hello.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle
The customers have been served.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle
Oh, no. I'm heading home immediately.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle
My husband asked me to buy 
milk and eggs on my way home.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle
Damn it... So she's the famous assassin 
known as the Thorn Princess...

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle
Die, you monster!

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle
FOLLOW MAMA AND PAPA

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle
We've just received breaking news.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle
Several bodies believed to belong 
to members of the Red Circus

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle
have been found in a building 
in the Northern District.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle
The Red Circus, an extremist group 
funded by foreign interests,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle
Papa.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle
I wanna watch cartoons. The news is boring.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle
has committed multiple 
indiscriminate acts of terrorism.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle
No.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle
The authorities are investigating 
this incident as one caused

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle
There's so much information I can gather 
just from a single public news outlet.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle
by internal strife within the group.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle
Next up, we have stock market news.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle
Okay, fine. You can change the channel.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle
In today's stock market, 
we see a drastic drop

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle
from where the numbers were 
before the weekend...

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle
Good morning, Bondman.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.520 align:middle
Your mission today is to 
tail a certain target.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle
You will then find out where they 
are keeping their secret weapon

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.330 align:middle
So exciting.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle
and destroy it in order 
to protect our country.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle
I'm home.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle
Welcome home, Yor—

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle
Here—hngh—is the milk... and the eggs...

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle
Er, uh... Thank you very much.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle
Um... Are you feeling unwell?

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle
No, not exactly...

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle
I'm just a little... No...

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle
I can't tell him.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle
I absolutely cannot tell him 
that I got shot in the butt

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle
while fighting a group of armed men,
 and it hurts so much!

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle
I mean, I took care of it, but...

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle
Sh... She was shot? By a gun?!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle
Mama... Are you going to die?

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle
Don't you worry, Miss Anya.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle
I won't die.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle
I'm a bit tired, so I'm going to bed.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle
I'm sure that... if I get 
a good night's sleep...

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle
it'll be better in the morning... right?

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle
Y-Yor is in a terrible mood!

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle
Is it because I asked her to go shopping?

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle
Yes, that must be it!

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle
This is just a marriage of convenience, 
yet I've been relying on her

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle
too much without realizing it, 
and it's upset her!

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle
Mama won't die even if 
she's been shot with a gun.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle
Wow.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle
This not good. Not good at all!

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle
Any discord in our family will 
lead to this mission failing!

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle
I must do everything in my 
power to remedy this at once!

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle
Papa has missed the mark.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle
Hopefully her mood will be 
better in the morning.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle
It didn't get better.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle
It didn't get better.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle
Good morning.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle
G-Good morning...

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle
Ow...

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle
I... I need to brighten her mood!

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle
Yor! We're both off today, so...

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle
Why don't we go on a date?

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle
A d-d...

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle
I want to thank you for always helping 
me with raising Anya and the chores.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle
I'd like you to relax to the utmost today.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle
A date...

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle
My boyfriend took me out 
on a cruise the other day!

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle
What kind of dates do you go on, Yor?

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle
Huh? I've never been on one.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle
No way. Surely you and 
your husband go on dates.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle
Oh, uh, um...

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle
I must at least experience 
this thing they call a "date,"

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle
or someone may suspect that 
we're a pretend family.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle
Um... We don't have to go 
if you're not feeling well.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle
I will go!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle
I would like to take this opportunity 
to learn everything that I can!

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle
Learn?

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle
I'll go change right away!

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle
Anya wants to go, too! 
Dates are so exciting!

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle
Er, sorry, but you're staying home.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle
Because it's a date.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle
Shock!

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle
Poo...

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle
Borf...

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle
All right, be good while we're gone.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle
C'mere a sec.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle
Okay, hang on! How many 
times do I have to tell you?!

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle
I'm an informant, not your errand boy!

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle
I had no other choice.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle
I can't leave Anya home alone,

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle
and this is a very important mission to 
ensure that we remain one happy family.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle
You said you wanted to create 
some new spy gadgets, didn't you?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle
I've already prepared you a check. Here.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle
Must you take advantage of 
my weakness every single time?!

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle
All right, let's go, Yor.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle
Allow me to take your hand.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle
Last night, I came up with 862 date 
plans to ensure that Yor has fun.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle
There's no way I could fail.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle
Um... I'm terribly sorry, Loid...

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle
Sitting down would mean my 
butt will be in even more pain.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle
But I'd prefer if we just 
walked around on this date.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle
Huh?! She's mad?!

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle
She's still mad?!

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle
This just killed 794 of those plans!

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle
O-Of course.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle
Then let's just take a casual little stroll.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle
I'm worried about Mama and Papa.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle
Well, if they've got a kid like you 
worried about them, they're screwed.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle
Come on and watch some 
cartoons inside, kiddo.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle
Go, Bondman!

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle
Follow him and protect world peace!

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle
Scruffy Head!

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle
I want to tail Mama and Papa!

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle
What the hell? That sounds like
some epic fun! Let's do it!

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle
Let's tail them!

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle
But your Papa's pretty sharp,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle
so we're gonna have to be careful 
and wear some disguises!

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle
Yep!

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle
I think you're bringing even more 
attention to yourself in that getup.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle
No problemo.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle
Right...

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle
You've been charged with 
guarding this house,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle
highly skilled agents of the 
Secret Organization P2!

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle
Bond, Director Chimera, 
and Agent Penguinman!

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle
Twilight, I'm gonna get a good 
look at the romance skills

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle
that have landed you countless women!

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle
I can't read their minds.
They're too far away.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle
What are those two doing?

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle
Spotted them instantly

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle
Is she pretending to be a spy again?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle
How is that even fun?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle
Anyway, I'll just think of this as part 
of the mission to keep our happy family,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle
and pretend I haven't noticed.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle
I'm sure she'll be fine 
since Franky's with her.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle
Loid?

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle
Oh, er, it's nothing.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle
More importantly, I need 
to brighten her mood.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle
Why don't we go shopping?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle
Central Mall

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle
You have such a striking figure, Yor. 
I'm sure you'd look great in pants, too.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle
Would you like to try these on?

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle
If I wear anything that tight,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle
it'll agitate my wound,
and I'll pass out in agony.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle
I can't.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle
Huh? Oh... I'm sorry.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle
Movie Theater

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle
Oh, my beloved!

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle
Please look me in the eyes 
and tell me you're lying!

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle
Yor...

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle
I won't let anyone else have 
your beautiful, proud soul!

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle
You might make a scene.
Maybe you should sit down?

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle
No, I'm fine.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle
If I sit down, my butt...

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle
Club

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle
If I sit down, my butt...

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle
Yor, it's dangerous to stand up...

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle
Pond at the Park

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle
But if I sit down, my butt...

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle
Spa

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle
Zoo

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle
My butt...

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle
What should I do? I can't 
concentrate on this date at all.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle
And here Loid is trying to 
teach me so many things!

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle
What should I do?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle
I think her mood is getting 
worse rather than better!

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle
Am I somehow picking all 
the wrong things to do?

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle
What is it?! What exactly does Yor like?!

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle
Did I not do enough research?!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle
Loid always tries to act cool, 
but he's failing left and right.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle
Scruffy, scruffy, scruff. What a loser!

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle
Scruffy Head, does your personality suck?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle
No!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle
As someone who can't get any girls, it's my 
absolute right to ridicule him right now!

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle
You poor thing.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle
What'd you say, you little—

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle
They're starting to become a distraction.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle
I'm sure you're a bit tired, 
so why don't we have dinner?

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle
All right.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle
Ah, you must be Mister Forger.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle
Please, have a seat.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle
We have a strict dress 
code at our restaurant,

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle
and we also do not allow guests under 
eighteen into our establishment.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle
Well, you heard the guy. Give it up.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle
Let's start heading home.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle
I'm getting kinda bored.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle
Th-Thorn Princess?! What the 
hell is she doing here?!

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle
What's up? You lookin' for a bathroom?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle
There's no doubt about it.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle
Ow!

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle
That's the assassin woman who 
raided our hideout yesterday!

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle
What's she doing here?

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle
When I survived that tragedy, 
I took it as God's mercy on my soul,

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle
and I decided to turn over a 
new leaf and get a proper job

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle
for the sake of the girlfriend 
I live with, too!

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle
I see. I see how it is, my comrades in hell.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle
I just need to kill her, right? 
I'll avenge the Red Circus!

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle
There's a bad guy in the restaurant!

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle
Die, Thorn Princess!

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle
Hurgh! That's right! You're the 
best assassin ever! I am defeated!

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle
Y-Yor, you're an assassin? 
Let's get a divorce.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle
The Forgers are done.
Let's get rid of Anya, too.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle
Come on. Let's get goin', kiddo.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle
No!

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle
What? Are we still playing this game?

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle
My family's in danger!

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle
Wait, is she worried that her parents 
might get divorced or something?

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle
She feels that strongly 
about a pretend family?

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle
O-Okay, fine... I guess I'll play 
this game with you a little longer.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle
Okay, our next game is called "Infiltration"!

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle
Infillytration!

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle
Would you like an aperitif?

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle
I'll have a glass of dry champagne.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle
I'll just take a cocktail. Any is fine.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle
This restaurant serves a very rare delicacy 
called "blowfish" from the far east.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle
I hear they serve it in 
one of their courses, too.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle
W-Wow...

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle
Blowfish is highly poisonous, 
but I'm told its flesh is quite exquisite.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle
Pardon, could you take this 
to the lady at table 3?

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle
Right away.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle
Drink a whole fish's worth of blowfish 
poison and go to hell, Thorn Princess!

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle
Scruffy Head, hurry!

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle
You can't rush this.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle
We gotta be careful when we're infiltrating. 
Get too loud, and they'll find us.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle
Thank you for waiting.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle
Oh, my. This has quite the color and aroma.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle
And it's so thick.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle
Mama, you can't drink that!

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle
Huh? I feel...

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle
I've avenged you, my brothers.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle
It's like the pain in my butt has
 gone away! I feel so much better!

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle
This woman had built up immunity to poisons.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle
Though my whole body 
does feel a bit tingly.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle
But I can sit down!

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle
I'm starting to get really hungry. 
I'm very excited to eat here.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle
Huh? Right...

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle
Is she in a better mood? 
Is it because of the drink?

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle
Huh? Wait... I'm pretty sure 
I put in enough to kill her. What?

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle
* Blowfish poison is very dangerous, so please don't try this at home

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle
There's a fine line between 
poison and medicine.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle
Ordinary people should 
take recommended doses

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle
and follow directions 
when using medication.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle
I guess I'll have to take 
things into my own hands.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle
I'll just finish her off myself!

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle
I should be able to build a makeshift 
bomb with the stuff in storage.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.780 align:middle
With that and that and that...

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle
THAT

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle
I won't be able to include a timer, 
so I'll just have to run into her with it.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle
I'm sorry, Catherine.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle
Please forgive me for being such a fool.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle
We'll be right above the dining hall soon.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle
Once we're right above, 
I'll lower you down on a wire,

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle
and you can hear what they're 
talking about... Huh?

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle
I should be able to make the 
bomb's body with **** and ****.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle
I'm pretty sure they were 
on the right-hand shelf.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle
After I put in the blue **** that's 
on the opposite shelf and some ****.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle
To make sure I get the most out of it,
 I'll need to include ****, too!

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle
Okay, this should work!

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle
Damn it! What is this?

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle
Olive oil?

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle
Who the hell spilled this here?

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle
Damn it! I don't have time for this!

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle
Washtub!

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle
Who the hell set up a prank like this?

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle
That's a perfect container for the bomb.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle
Wait, this is a bit too small.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle
Huh? Hey, wait... Huh?!

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle
Why was there an already-completed bomb here?

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle
And what are these? Peanuts?

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle
A peanut bomb?!

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle
Wait...

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle
Are they working with the Thorn Princess?

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle
A kid?

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle
Red Circus guy.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle
She knows who I am?

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle
If you've learned your lesson, 
stay away from An—from us.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle
Got it? There won't be a next time.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle
You need to completely 
give up being a bad guy...

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle
and make Cathurin a happy lady.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle
She even knows about Catherine?!

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle
I guess she saw right through me...

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle
Thorn Princess is a fearsome foe.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle
I can't believe she's got an insane 
kid like that working for her, too.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle
We live in completely different worlds.
 I'm not cut out for this.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle
I'm going to forget all this 
and live a normal life.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle
The atmosphere in that 
restaurant was quite lively.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle
But everything was so delicious!

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle
Yes.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle
Thank goodness. She seems 
to be in a much better mood.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle
I think I was able to protect the 
peace of the Forgers for now.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle
This is all thanks to Anya. Heh.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle
So, hey... Where'd you run off to earlier?

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle
Thank you very much, Loid.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle
Ever since I was little, I spent most of my 
time taking care of my brother or working,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle
so I rarely ever had a chance to have fun.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle
So...

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle
You made me really happy today.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle
If it's not too much trouble, 
please invite me out again sometime.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle
When I'm not injured.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle
I would love to. Anytime.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle
Oh, look! There's a traveling 
amusement park over there!

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle
It might close soon, but let's go see it anyway.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle
Papa! Anya wants to go 
on the Ferris wheel, too!

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle
And the amusement park!

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle
Hey, wait! I thought we were 
tailing them! Are we done?!

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle
Why, though?!

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle
The medicine (poison) had worn off

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle
The medicine—that is, 
the poison—had worn off.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle
I don't understand women.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle
The bright crimson that 
appears right before my eyes

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle
Stretches approximately 40,000 kilometers

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle
Our wounds that inch closer behind us

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle
Make us wander even more 
when we're already lost

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle
The unseeable, scentless, unmistakable future

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle
Stabbed me in the back!

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle
So...

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle
Let me stay by your side tonight

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle
Just for tonight, I'm going to be serious

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle
Come closer to me

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle
Even the future we prayed for

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle
Has a different path

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle
My dear

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle
Our malice for each other

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle
Might just get to us

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle
Or maybe not

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle
BOND'S STRATEGY TO STAY ALIVE
