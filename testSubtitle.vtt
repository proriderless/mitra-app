Look at these stunning winter lights!

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.410 align:middle

Aren't you two a happy couple?

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle
Why, thank you.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.210 align:middle
Ugh, just kill me now.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.820 align:middle
Getting to see the lights with my 
girlfriend is a dream come true.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle
She seems to be a little camera shy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.390 align:middle
Hey, stop! Come on, quit it!

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle
On days like these, at least we've 
got video games to keep us company.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle
Quick, get a close-up!

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle
Right, Mihari?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle
Don't lump me in with you.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle
Besides, I happen to have a date.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle

S-So...

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle
What made you call me out 
here today of all days?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle
It's a date! What else?!

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle
What?!

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle
Since when did Mihari have the time?

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle
I gotta see this sweet-talker 
with my own two eyes.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle
O-Oh, you meant hers...

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle
I need you to be my escort. 
Too many people, you know?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle
S-Someone's coming!

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle
Sorry!

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle
I got caught up!

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle
The audacity!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle
I'm sorry, okay?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle
What took you so long?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle
It took me a bit to get ready.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle
Wait... Onee-chan?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle
Fine, I'll let it slide.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle
Thanks, bestie.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle
Jeez!

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle
'Course. Come on, let's go!

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle
I knew it couldn't have been a real date!

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle
Yeah!

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle
Honestly, what was she 
thinking calling it that?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle
You really love your sister, huh?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle
Welp, that's a relief.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle
Time to head home.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle
What?!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle
W-We're here now anyway.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle
Why don't we follow them 
a little while longer?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle
M-Maybe there's more to their 
relationship than meets the eye!

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle
Who are you, Miyo-chan?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle
Still, I guess it would be 
rude of me to call it off

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle
after she came all this way out for me...

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle
Okay, you're on!

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle
The pursuit continues!

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle
Hurray!

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle
They'll love it!

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle
Something wrong?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle
Oh, just my imagination.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle
Shall we go?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle
There are so many places to check out!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle
For real! Where should we start?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle
Sorry for the wait!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle
Ready, go!

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle
Well?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle
It's perfect!

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle
Looks like two friends shopping to me.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle
I figured.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle
Tailing them is starting 
to get a little old.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle
I'm getting tired too. Wanna head back?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle
Wait, but... uh...

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle
Oh, I know! Why don't we 
do some shopping too?!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle
You could pick stuff out for me!

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle
What?!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle
Come on! You always seem to know what to wear.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle
O-Okay...

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle
Hang on. Now it's like 
we're the ones on a date!

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle
Momiji's bound to be mistaken 
for my boyfriend, too.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle
Hey! What about something like this?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle
Look!

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle
N-No way! Absolutely not!

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle
Fine, if this is how it has to be...

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle
She looks cute! Hurray!

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle
The skirt's too short, though!

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle
No one's gonna mistake her for a boy now.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle
Can't you pick out something less feminine?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle
No! That's the whole point!

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle
What?

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle
Oh!

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle
Here! Try this one on, too!

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle
Really?! But I'm not into frilly stuff!

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle
Come on! You might as well!

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle
Wait a sec, Mahiro-chan!

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle
Just trust me, okay?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle
Wait. Onii—

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle
Mahiro-chan? What brings you here?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle
Shoot! They found us!

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle
You've been following us the 
whole time, haven't you?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle
You noticed, huh?

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle
Nothing gets past you, Kaede-chan.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle
Momiji's with you too, isn't she?

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle
Where could she be?

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle
What? You're on a date?

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle
As if!

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle
Aha!

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle
Wait! She's—

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle
Let's look behind curtain number one!

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle
My goodness...

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle
She's adorable!

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle
Totally! Cute as a button!

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle
On second thought, I'm kinda feeling this!

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle
Um...

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle
Oh, no! She's having an awakening!

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle
Well, we got what 
we came for on our end.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle
What shall we do now?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle
Why don't we hang out for a bit?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle
Can't go wasting an opportunity like this.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle
Can we, Mahiro-chan?

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle
I'm so glad I got to see this with you guys!

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle
We're home!

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle
Look at you, you go-getter!

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle
Since when did you two start dating?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle
Quit joking around, will you?

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle
Why'd you lie about having a date, anyway?!

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle
You could've just told me you and 
Kaede-chan were going shopping!

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle
Don't tell me... you were worried about me?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle
Perish the thought!

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle
Hey, I'm sorry.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle
I did have a reason for 
keeping it from you, though.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle
I had Kaede help me pick something out.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle
Merry Christmas, Onii-chan!

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle
I wanted to surprise you!

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle
Honestly...

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle
She really had me fooled.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle
Oh, and FYI...

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle
We got a matching one for Momiji-chan, too.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle
Why would you do that?

Here, open wide.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle
You really pulled out all the stops.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle
You got the kotatsu out and everything.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle
Well, I thought we should at least 
have it out for New Year's.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle

It's midnight, Onii-chan!

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle
We'll be taking a look at the New 
Year's celebrations around Japan.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle

Can I get my New Year's 
money now, sister dearest?

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle
Of course, sweetie!

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle
Easy win, guys.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle
That's way too few zeros! I'm in 
middle school now, you know?!

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle
No, you're a grown adult, Onii-chan.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle
Oh, that's right...

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle
He's starting to lose it...

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle
Here's hoping life as a girl

You got this!

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle
I'll turn back to normal someday! I swear!

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle
Ah, what a wonderful New 
Year's Day for staying in.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle
I'm hungry.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle
Morning! I made mochi soup.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle
We're not having osechi?

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle
It's a hassle to prep, you know?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle
Were you looking forward to it?

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle
Not really. I think I can live without it.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle
As long as I can stuff my face 
and nap all day, I'll be happy.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle
Being productive has its 
rewards too, you know?

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle
But still...

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle
I guess it is nice to kick your 
feet up every once in a while.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle
Oh?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle
So you finally see where I'm coming from!

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle
Look at you! I'm so proud!

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle
B-Be that as it may!

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle
Come, Onii-chan. It's time to get dressed.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle
W-Wait, don't tell me...!

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle
We gotta ring in the new year!

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle
It's the most crowded place 
you could have taken me...

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle
Hey, look, shrine maidens.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle
Come on, snap out of it!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle
Quit retreating to your happy place!

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.940 align:middle
I prepared a little incentive for you.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle
You did?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle
Oh, there they are!

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle
Happy New Year!

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle
My incentive is here!

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle
You look stunning, Kaede!

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle
I managed to score a cute rental.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle
I-Is she a samurai?

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle
She refused to wear anything else...

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle
Don't I look cool?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle
Oh, she must be going through a phase.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle
I hope you find yourself soon. All the best.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle
Let's get going, then!

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle
We gotta get in line.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle
Coming!

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle
You should've worn a kimono too, Mihari!

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle
Yeah!

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle
How come you get to dress 
normally and I don't?

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle
I-I wouldn't look good in one anyway...

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle
We finally made it!

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle
I better get my money's worth 
for standing in line so long!

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle
Now you're just being greedy.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle
I wish for my brother to 
live a respectable life.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle
I wish that we can all stay 
close with each other.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle
Go on!

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle
You too, Mahiro-chan.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle
R-Right...

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle
I wish...

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
No. 50

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
Omikuji

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
Great Blessing

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle
Fortune

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle
Yay! I got the best one!

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle
Pretty weird for a science geek to 
get all excited about her fortune.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle
Doesn't mean I can't participate!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle
Hey, wait...

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle
Which is better? A small 
blessing or a great one?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle
Asahi?

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle
Wait, Mahiro-chan?

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle
Hey, Miyo-chan! Hey, Asahi!

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle
Happy New Year!

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.580 align:middle
Happy New Year!

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle
Your kimono's so cute!

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle
Oh, shush! So is yours, Miyo-chan!

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle
So we meet again, Momijiro!

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle
Why are you in men's hakama?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle
W-Well, you know...

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.100 align:middle
I think they look cool...

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.080 align:middle
The little ones are all here!

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.110 align:middle
I know!

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle
Bet you can't beat me at target shooting!

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle
Hey!

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle
You gotta save me, Mahiro-chan!

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle
Oh, my...

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle
Oh la la...

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle
A Precious World

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle
To A New Year

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle
A Clear Sky

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle
I think I'm hungry.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle
Wanna get something from the food stalls?

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle
I don't have any more money!

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle
Then why not come over to our place?

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle
I went overboard on the osechi, anyway.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle
Kaede-chan's homemade osechi?!

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle
Let's go! What are we waiting for?!

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle
O.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle
Ni.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle
Ma.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle
I.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle
Wow!

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle
Kaede-chan's homemade osechi!

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle
It's a good thing you guys are here.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle
I may have made a little too much.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle
I told you you were overworking yourself!

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle
New Year's isn't quite the 
same without it, huh?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle
Maybe I should have made some after all.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle
Every osechi dish has a special 
meaning behind it, right?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle
Rolled konbu represents 
"yorokobu," or happiness.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle
I get it! Yorokonbu!

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle
And black beans...

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle
bring good health so that you can work hard.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle
All right!

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle
Good luck working hard, then, Onee-chan!

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle
And since rolled omelettes resemble scrolls,
they're said to bring academic success.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle
So good luck with your studies, Mahiro-chan!

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle
Here!

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle
Th-Thank you...

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle
Thanks for the meal!

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle
I'm happy you liked it!

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle
We have amazake too, if you want.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle
I don't think I've ever tried it!

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle
You're still too young 
to drink alcohol, Doc!

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle
Actually, it's generally okay 
for minors to drink it.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle
In small amounts, that is.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle
Since the alcohol is cooked off anyway.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle
Yeah, so it's totally legal.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle
There you go. Try some.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle
Um...

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle
Mihari?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle
Onii-chan!

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle
W-Watch it, you dummy!

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle
There are people around!

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle
What? Just from amazake?!

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle
Come on, claws off.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle
She's your sister, remember?

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle
Boo!

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle
Then I'll take you instead!

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle
She's on a drunken rampage!

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle
Everyone, fall back!

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle
Take refuge in Momiji's room 
before she can launch an attack!

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle
You too, Miyo-chan! Hurry!

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle
I can't. I'm...

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle
My eyes are locked on, and I can't move!

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle
No! Miyo-chan!

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle
Miyo-chan!

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle
She's awake!

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle
A-Are you all right?

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle
What happened just now?

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle
You're banned from alcohol 
for life, that's what.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle
Onee-sama!

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle
It's been a while since we've gotten 
to spend New Year's like this, huh?

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle
You're right.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle
So what exactly did you pray 
for back at the shrine?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle
What? Uh... It's a secret.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle
But I wanna know!

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle
Come on, tell me!

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle
Quit nagging!

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle
Honestly...

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle
I haven't the faintest idea.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle
