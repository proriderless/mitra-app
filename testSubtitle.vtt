00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.480 align:middle
On a white, snowy night,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle
my life was leaving me in a pool of red.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle
Am I really going to die?

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.540 align:middle
Probably.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle
You would've survived 
if you hadn't chased me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.990 align:middle
What a ridiculous waste of your life.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle
Still... I'm glad I went after you.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle
Because... I was able to marry you.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle
Uh... Is this...

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle
another world?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle
Can't be.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle
Oh, good morning, darling.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle
G-Good morning, Tsukasa-chan!

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle
What's wrong? You look shook.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle
Well, I was just surprised when 
you popped up so suddenly.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle
Well, why don't we get to breakfast?

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle
We've been married for a while now, but...

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle
I'm definitely not used to it yet.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle
TONIKAWA

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle
TONIKAWA

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle
My wife is extremely cute.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle
I don't know how I feel 
about that shark movie.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle
Really? I like the way it depicted 
the family's relationship,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle
and the story was pretty easy to follow.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle
Oh, come on, darling!

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle
I don't want familial love and ease 
of comprehension from shark movies!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle
I want to wonder, "Wait, 
sharks don't actually fly, right?"

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle
Or, "Why would they waste budget 
on a scene like this?!"

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle
And, "What in the world am I watching?"
 That's the good stuff!

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle
Do you get me?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle
I-I see. That is enlightening.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle
Every day is full of surprises 
with Tsukasa-chan.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle
She saved my life on that 
snowy night two years ago,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle
and took her leave before 
I even knew her name.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle
We were then suddenly reunited and 
began our married life together.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle
We turned in our marriage registration,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle
I proposed to her,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle
we bought wedding rings,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle
visited my parents,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle
had our house burn down,

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle
and started living with my friends.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle
Things have been really busy.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle
You've been working all day,
 haven't you, darling?

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle
Yeah. I wanted to get this 
data turned in a little early.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle
So you're saying you don't have time to 
entertain your adorable newlywed wife?

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle
Huh?!

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle
Are you saying you want me to pay 
attention to you, Tsukasa-chan?

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle
I really do!

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle
Your newlywed wife was disappointed 
by that movie and wants attention!

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle
Well, it's still early... Wanna go to the movies?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle
You mean it?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle
Yeah! That sounds great! I'd love to go!

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle
Is it gonna be okay, though?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle
I'm not being a nuisance, am I?

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle
It'll be fine. I'll finish this right up.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle
Okay, in that case, I'll root for you 
by your side so you can finish faster!

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle
Th-That's okay.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle
It'd probably be a better idea 
to go ahead and get ready.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle
Got it!

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle
Was there a movie you 
were looking forward to?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle
You seem really excited.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle
I was wondering if you've been 
wanting to go for a while now.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle
You could've gone without me, y'know.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle
Don't be silly!

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle
The fun part is getting 
to go with you, darling.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle
I figured we should go to a good 
theater if we were gonna go out,

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle
and this place really is nice!

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle
It sure is.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle
Let's go on in, then, darling.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle
Yeah.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle
Th-These are premium luxury seats!

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle
Should we really be splurging like this?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle
Well, since we don't go out a lot...

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle
How about it? Want to get 
any drinks or popcorn?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle
That's a real gamble with 
this movie, darling.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle
It's two and a half hours long.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle
You'll be doomed if you need to use 
the bathroom partway through.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle
G-Good point...

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle
It's about to start.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle
I think, in the old days, couples went 
to the theater to hold hands, kiss,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle
and use the darkness as 
a chance to fool around.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle
I'm not getting that impression 
from my wife at all, though.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle
Still, it's really cute how she 
enjoys the movie so earnestly.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle
Oh, the movie started.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle
My wife as she's thrown for a loop 
by an unexpected plot twist.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle
My wife as she's surprised 
by a shocking development.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle
My wife getting excited 
as the tension ramps up.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle
My wife filled with dread at the danger 
the heroes find themselves in.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle
And at the climax...

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle
My wife unable to stop crying 
because she's so moved.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle
Wow, she really is enjoying this movie.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle
We should come again.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle
A date at the movies, huh?

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle
You two really seem to enjoy life. Nice.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle
Kusatsu-Style Yufuin Bathhouse

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle
Wait, how do you know about that?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle
Tsukassan mentioned it when she was working.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle
Said she had a great time!

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle
I see. That's good to know.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle
I'm thrilled you two are 
enjoying newlywed life.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle
But that said... are you two 
not going to have a wedding?

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle
Good question. I don't think 
we've even talked about it.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle
Your parents didn't ask about it?

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle
Nope. It's never even come up.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle
What about Tsukassan's family?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle
Tsukasa-chan's?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle
I'm not sure. I think they're glad for her...

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle
But if it was an actual wedding, I'm not sure.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle
Well, there are a lot of couples 
who don't bother anymore.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle
Would you want one if you got married?

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle
Well, if it's an option.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle
I'd want a super fancy one, 
with a gondola and fireworks!

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle
Husband

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.610 align:middle
I-I see.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle
You might want to ask her about it, though.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle
Weddings are basically for the 
sake of the bride, anyway.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle
Besides, I'm sure you want to see it...

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle
The sight of your beautiful 
wife in a wedding dress.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle
She's right. I would like to see that.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle
A wedding?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle
Yeah. Kaname-chan mentioned it today.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle
This chopped burdock you 
made is delicious, darling.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle
Really? Thanks.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.800 align:middle
Tsukasa-chan, do you want to have a wedding?

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle
Well, let me think...

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle
A wedding, huh?

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle
Not at all, no.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle
I-I see.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle
I mean, a wedding means a gathering 
of dozens of friends and relatives.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle
And a reception includes stuff like 
cutting the cake and speeches...

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle
To top it off, you have to kiss 
in front of a bunch of people.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle
Plus, having to wear something 
as fancy as a wedding dress...

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle
That'd be...

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle
j-just plain embarrassing.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle
I see! That does really 
sound like a good idea!

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle
Were you even listening to me?

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle
Yes! I would like to see you wearing 
a super fancy wedding dress!

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle
Okay, but see, I was trying 
to say that'd be embarrassing!

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle
Well, they say there's 
no time like the present.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle
Let's see if we can have a 
wedding somewhere next week!

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle
Excuse me?

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle
Huh? Did I do something wrong?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle
That's like a line out of 
an isekai story, darling.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle
Oh, I get what this is.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle
Thank you for the meal.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle
Th-Thank you for the meal...

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle
I have to say, your kung fu is weak, darling.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle
Wh-What do you mean?

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle
I'm saying you have no idea what 
a wedding ceremony involves.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle
I don't?

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle
You don't!

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle
Let's start with question one:

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle
How do you arrange a wedding ceremony?

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle
You're a clever one, darling,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle
so let's have you act out your answer.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle
Three, two, one, action.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle
Huh?! Act it out?!

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle
Well, uh... First, you call the venue, and then...

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle
Hello, is this the venue?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle
Um, I'd like to have a wedding.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle
What days are available?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle
Oh, I see. So Friday is available?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle
I'd like a reservation for two on Friday night...

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle
You think this is going out for drinks?!

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle
Kaname-chan?

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle
What do you think a wedding is?!

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle
You ain't gonna get a gondola or  
fireworks with a single phone call!

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle
Huh?!

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle
What gondola?

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle
Sorry for barging in.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle
One of the neighbors gave us a watermelon,
 so I thought I'd share.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle
Thanks for that.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle
This is really good watermelon.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle
Sure is.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle
Anyway, Kaname, it seems my darling has 
no idea how much of a trial a wedding is.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle
Sure seems like it.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle
I-It's a trial?!

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle
Just for example, how much 
do you think a wedding costs?

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle
Good question... On the cheap side, 
probably around 150,000 or 160,000 yen?

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle
That's just wrong.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle
He's got a severe case of "ignorance 
of things I don't care about."

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle
What, am I wrong?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle
Well, for starters, Senpai...

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle
Here's the minimum estimate for a wedding at 
a certain kingdom that's considered magical.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle
S-Seven million yen?!

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle
And there's the reality check.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle
Looks like it.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle
But... seven million?! 
You could buy a car for that!

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle
Yep, you sure could.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle
If you get far enough from the city, 
you could even buy a house for that.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle
Seriously?

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle
I always thought a wedding was, like...

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle
You promise to love each 
other in front of a priest,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle
your wife cries a little bit while 
reading a letter from her parents,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle
and you basically wrap it up in one day.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle
Is it actually a whole process that involves 
a bunch of traveling over an entire year?

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle
You're not a band, and it's not a tour!

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle
Why would you need to travel all over?

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle
I just can't imagine why it'd 
cost this much otherwise!

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle
I-I see... So that's it.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle
No wonder everyone cries so emotionally.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle
They sure do.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle
It'd be kind of a waste of money not to.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle
Very, very nice! Keep it up, Chitose-chan!

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle
Fight back a bit more during 
this next round, Charlotte!

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle
Aurora, how long have we been going?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle
Five minutes.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle
I can't stop wondering.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle
What are those two going 
to do about a wedding?

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle
Those two?

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle
You mean Conan-kun and Amuro-san?!

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle
Not them!

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle
I mean Nee-sama and that 
husband of hers! Them!

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle
That really is a good question!

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle
Come on!

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle
Don't young folks these days 
worry less about formalities?

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle
Easy!

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle
And Tsukasa-chan gets embarrassed easily!

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle
In my homeland, 
weddings usually have 200 guests,

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle
and over 1,000 isn't unheard of!

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle
That'd be rough if you're easily embarrassed.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle
How does anyone even know that many people?!

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle
With a number like that, there's bound
 to be a few strangers in there.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle
It's mostly...

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle
complete strangers!

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle
Why so casual?!

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle
Still, it's not like the 
families have met yet, either.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle
A wedding might be a good 
way to arrange that.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle
Here.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle
Would you go if you were 
invited, Chitose-chan?

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle
I mean... of course I would.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle
Wow, really?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle
If you go, you can't try to ruin it.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle
I'd do no such thing!

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle
I might be annoyed about her being married...

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle
But I'd like Grandmother to see 
Nee-sama in a wedding dress.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle
For Tokiko-sama...

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle
Now that you mention it... yeah.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle
We're closed for today

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle
See you tomorrow!

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle
Seven million is on the pricey side,

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle
but even the average is still 
in the 3-4 million range.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle
I had no idea weddings were so expensive.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle
It's practically an event of a lifetime...

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
But what's this "betrothal money"?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
Expenses Outside of the Ceremony

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
Introductory Lunch Meeting

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
60,000 yen

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
Engagement Party (Venue)     180,000 yen

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
Betrothal Money

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle
1,000,000 yen

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle
It's another million outside 
of the cost of the ceremony.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.290 align:middle
Betrothal money is—

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle
Whoa, you scared me!

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle
A-Aya-san?

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle
You were here all along?

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle
What are you doing here, actually?

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle
Well, the thing is,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle
I was playing video games in the living room 
all day before Kaname-chan got mad at me,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle
so I lied about going to clean the baths,
 and have been gaming in here!

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle
That's just gonna make her madder!

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle
Putting that aside, 
betrothal money is something that

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle
one side presents to the other, 
along with the engagement gifts,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle
to help prepare for the wedding.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle
As smart as you are, you really don't know 
much about this sort of thing, do you?

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle
I guess that's true.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle
I didn't even know how expensive weddings 
were until Kaname-chan taught me about it.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle
Well, they're expensive, and they 
can take an entire year to arrange.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle
What?! Wait, that can't be right, can it?

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle
I mean, people get married 
every day at Omotesando...

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle
And every one of those couples has been 
planning for that day a year in advance!

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle
What?!

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle
B-But a whole year? What exactly 
takes that long to arrange?!

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle
That is a very valid question.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle
The mystery only seems to grow.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.840 align:middle
I... I guess it does.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle
Well, for one thing, if you're 
inviting friends and coworkers,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.100 align:middle
you need to send out invitations, right?

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.340 align:middle
And that needs to be two or
 three months in advance.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle
Then there's confirming RSVPs, 
seating arrangements...

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle
Say your parents live out in the country.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle
You can't exactly go, "We're getting 
married! Come by tomorrow!"

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle
Everything needs to be arranged. 
So no matter what...

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle
It ends up taking time.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle
Care for some fruit milk, darling?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle
Sure, thanks.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle
An indirect smooch!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle
Then there's choosing the menu, 
the table decorations,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle
getting an emcee, selecting the party favors...

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle
Just a ton of things to do.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle
Which is why, personally, I'm not 
interested in investing all that effort.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle
That's not right!

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle
You won't know if it's worth 
the effort until you try!

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle
I'm sure Nasa-kun wants to see 
Tsukacchan in a wedding dress!

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle
He wants to see it and get excited over it!

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle
What do you mean by "excited"?!

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle
And do you realize the kind of price 
tag we're talking about here?!

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle
Still, though...

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle
Three or four million isn't exactly out 
of reach, with a bit of dedication.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle
Darling, that kind of 
dedication is unnecessary!

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle
That's not where you need 
to dedicate anything!

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle
Very well! Let's buy an issue of Zexy!

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle
Zexy? The wedding magazine they 
sell at convenience stores?

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle
Precisely!

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle
The first step toward a 
wedding is buying Zexy!

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle
And that's why the two of you will 
buy and read Zexy together!

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle
Never read it myself, but there's 
bound to be helpful info in there!

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle
I-I guess we're going to the 
convenience store, then.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle
We needed milk for tomorrow, anyway.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle
Y-Yeah.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle
Will this work for milk?

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle
Tasty
 Milk

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle
Yeah. But we're out of butter, 
too, so we'll also need that.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle
That just leaves Zexy. Zexy...

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle
Darling!

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle
I'm feeling like ice cream.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle
Chocolate

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle
Big Monaka

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle
Crispity Crunchety!!

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle
You want to split this?

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle
Sounds good.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle
So, ice cream and a copy of Zexy...

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle
It's heavy!

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle
I never picked one up before, 
so I didn't realize it was so thick!

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle
It's like a phone book.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle
Zexy Capital Region Edition

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle
It comes with extras, 
and it's still only 300 yen!

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle
That's quite a bargain.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle
"Top 100 Venues in the Capital Region"?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle
There are that many just around Tokyo?

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle
There's something embarrassing 
about buying it together, though.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle
Why?

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle
I mean, come on...

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle
It's a magazine that a couple thinking about
 getting married would probably buy, so...

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle
How do I put this? It gives 
off real happiness vibes.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle
I-I guess it does.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle
Right?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle
Man, I got so self-conscious, 
I was bright red at the register.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle
Y-Yeah.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle
Well, to cool down, how about some ice cream?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle
Appreciate it.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle
Here you go, darling.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle
Thanks.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle
Surveying an Actual Wedding Ceremony
What to Be Careful About!!

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle
Y'know, reading this...

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.550 align:middle
There really is a ton of stuff to 
decide on before a wedding ceremony.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle
Right?

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle
There are a lot of couples who 
even get into fights about it.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle
I read about it in Spirits!

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle
In Spirits?! She got this info from manga?!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle
Granted, you're enough of a sweetheart 
that I doubt we'd get into a fight.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle
But I like things how they are 
right now. All... lovey-dovey.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle
What'd you say, Tsukasa-chan?

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle
I don't think I'm gonna tell you.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle
I just think that, instead of overcoming 
the nightmare of arranging a ceremony,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle
we should go to the movies, eat together,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle
go to the convenience store, 
share some ice cream...

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle
The way things are now is 
peaceful, and that's a relief.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle
I see.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle
So we shouldn't think about a 
wedding ceremony right now?

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle
We shouldn't! It's too soon for us.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle
Someday, when the time comes 
for us to be truly blessed...

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle
That'll be the chance

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle
for the two of us to take our 
time and really think it over.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle
Our wedding, that is.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle
We only just got married, after all.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle
Yeah.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle
You're right.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle
Today was really nice.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle
I'm glad we went to the movies together.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle
You smell so nice, Tsukasa-chan.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle
Come on, your breath tickles.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle
But, y'know,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle
I really would like to see 
you in a wedding dress.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle
Then maybe in private... 
I'll show it to only you.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle
Really?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle
Yeah.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle
Then that'll be our private wedding ceremony.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle
Do you promise to honor and love Yuzaki Nasa?

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle
Yes, I do.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.310 align:middle
Yuzaki Nasa, do you—

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle
Yes, I do!

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle
C'mon, darling, let me finish!

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle
And now, I may kiss the bride.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle
My wife is always so incredible.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle
TONIKAWA

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle
The other day, someone in town 
asked me, "Are you happy right now?"

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle
Oh, yeah, that does happen sometimes.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle
And I replied right away!

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle
"Yes, I am!"

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle
"A meteor could hit

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle
or aliens could invade,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle
but I'd still be the happiest 
man in the universe!"

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle
You're unstoppable, huh, darling?
