I've been bewitched by its siren song

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle
I dove right in and the water's great

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle
Cute outfits, makeup galore, and hairstyles aplenty

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle
Awaken, my inner cute girl!

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle
With proper stimulation comes a happy ending?

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle

Now I can slack off to my heart's content!

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle
I knew long breaks from school would pose an issue.

Okay.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle
Time to plan out my schedule with a graph.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle
I'll wanna sleep in late in the mornings

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle
and have plenty of chill time in the evenings, too.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle

Well, without further ado!

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle
It's time to play nothing but video games from now until dinner!

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle
That's no different from what you normally do.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle
It is the will of Gaia that I indulge in this way.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle
Not today.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle
Oh, that must be them!

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle
Y-You plan on dragging me outside again, don't you?!

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle
I won't go along with it this time, okay?!

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle
But I thought we were having a sleepover today.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle
Weren't you the one who suggested it, Mahiro-chan?

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle
We're coming in!

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle
A... sleepover?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.030 align:middle
When did I say—

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle
I brought my PJs and everything!

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle
I brought mine too.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle
Oh?

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle
Were you playing a game, Mahiro-chan?

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle
Ooo!

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle
Can we play too, Mahiron?! Can we?!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle
Yeah, of course!

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle
Oh, but this is only a two-player game...

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle
Ta-da!

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle

You go, Mihari!

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle
Whoa, that was close!

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle
Oh yeah, it's bomb time!

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle
I can just dodge it, you know?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle
Oh, no! I'm gonna get hit!

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle
Go, go, go!

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle
Dinner's ready!

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle
Coming!

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle
Onimai.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle
Thanks for dinner!

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle
You're such a good cook, Doc!

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle
I told you I'm not a doctor.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle
All right, bring by your empty plates.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle
You heard her, Mahiron.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle
You lost, remember?

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle
Too bad you were the one who suggested these stakes.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle
Come on, I let them win.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle
They're our guests, after all.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle
You seem pretty devastated for someone who lost on purpose.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle
See? Aren't games more enjoyable with friends?

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle
Let's play that game again sometime.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle
Th-That... depends on the game.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle
Yeah!

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle
It was fun, wasn't it?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle
I wanna play again.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle
You could just admit it, you know?

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle
Admit what?

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle
I'm done...

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle
Nice work!

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle
Good job!

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle
So do you wanna keep playing?

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle
It's getting late. We'd bother the neighbors, right?

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle
I worked up a sweat too, 
so I kinda wanna take a bath now.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle
Actually, same.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle
Hmm...

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle
Well, I don't mind going last, 
so why don't you guys—

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle
Let's go in pairs!

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle
If we go in one at a time, 
the water'll get cold before we're done.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle
Th-That's a big no-no!

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle
Why's that?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle
I-It's just... Um...

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle
Come on, Mahiron! I can wash your back for you!

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle
I-In that case, I can wash your hair for you too!

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle
Uh...

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle
Um...

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle
Come on, you two. Settle down.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle
Miyo-chan!

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle
How about the OG AsaMomi pairing?

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle
Asa?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle
Momi?

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle
It's no use! She's been corrupted!

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle
You mean Asahi and I should battle each other for it?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle
Oh! You wanna go?

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle
All right!

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle
Let's rock-paper-scissors!

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle
Hell yeah! I'm going with rock!

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle
Hold it, hold it!

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle
I-I-I'm gonna...

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle
What the—?!

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle
We're getting in together. This is your own fault.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle
H-Huh?!

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle
U-Um...

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle
I don't know how I feel about you seeing me this close up...

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle
You've gotten bigger, huh?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle
Wha?! That's sexual harassment!

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle
That's not what I meant!

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle
We used to bathe together when we were little, remember?

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.050 align:middle
I was just reminiscing.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle
Well, you've gotten smaller.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle
And whose fault is that?!

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle
The bath is free! You guys can go now!

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle
Wow!

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle
You're so cute, Mahiro-chan!

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle
You smell good too, Mahiron!

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle
Wha?

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle
You're just smelling the shampoo!

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle
Come on, Asahi! It's time for our bath!

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle
Uwaraba!

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle
You too, Miyo-chan!

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle
B-But it'll be too cramped with the three of us.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle
Come on, it's a sleepover. We might as well!

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle
You can wash up first, Miyo-chan.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle
Me and Momiji will go ahead and get in the tub.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle
O-Okay...

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle
This is like my worst nightmare!

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle
Though getting to see these two interact up close is a treat.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle
Blub, blub, blub, blub.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle
It's been so long since we've bathed together, huh, Asahi?

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle
Do you remember?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle
Hm?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle
Back when we first became friends.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle
My name's Asahi!

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle
I'm Momiji. Nice to meet you!

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle
It's a topknot! You're a samurai!

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle
Nice to meet you, Momijiro!

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle
Mo-mi-ji!

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle
That's so cool! I wish I had a topknot!

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle
Maybe I should put my hair up too.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle
You're so weird.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle
Here, I have an idea.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle
See? Pretty cute, huh?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle
Hup!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle
Take that!

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.720 align:middle
Yay!

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle
Wanna take a bath?

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle
Sure!

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle
Is it okay if we go in together?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle
Oh! Did you not want to?

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle
N-No, it's okay.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle
I bathe with my big brother all the time.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle
Is yours gonna grow in later?

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle
What?

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle
I know we were little, 
but that was still pretty rude.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle
My goodness.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle
We used to wash each other too, huh?

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle
May I request a reenactment?!

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle
All right, then, Miyo-chin.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle
C'mere and I'll wash you.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle
I-I didn't mean me...

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle
Come on, now! Don't be shy!

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle
That actually feels kinda nice...

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle
I used to wash my brother's back all the time, you know?

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle
Okay, now reach for the sky!

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle
Gotta get your underarms!

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle
This is kinda brutal.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle
Onimai.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle
Onimai.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle
Mahiro

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle
Mahiro

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle
You really think we should be sleeping in the same room?

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle
That's the whole point of a sleepover, don't you think?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle
Or would you rather sleep with your big sister too?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle
I said I'm sorry about the bath thing, okay?

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle
I know for a fact you're harmless, after all.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle
You say that like I'm some wild animal.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle
Futons!

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle
This is so exciting!

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle
Asahi! You're in the way!

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle
Was it cramped, being in the bath together?

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle
It was totally fine!

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle
Th-Though we did have a small incident...

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle
Wow!

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle
You look so grown-up, Miyo-chan!

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle
I'm an observer, not a participant, okay?!

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle
Just try and give her a little space.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle
What the hell happened in that bath?

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle
Well, you're all set, so have fun.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle
Don't stay up all night, okay?

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle
See ya later, Doc!

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle
Good night!

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle
Okay, what now? What are we doing?!

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle
Whoa, there!

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle
Let's decide who's sleeping where first.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle
I'll sleep here.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle
This one's mine, anyway.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle
Then I'll take the one next to hers!

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle
No fair!

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle
Let's rock-paper-scissors for it this time!

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle
Hell yeah! I'm going with scissors!

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle
It's Asahi. I should have known I was overthinking it.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle
Honesty wins again!

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle
Be careful, Mahiro-chan.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle
Asahi's a nightmare to sleep next to.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle
Wha? Really? Aw, man...

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle
I'll be good, I promise.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle
Take this!

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle
You little...

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle
You've done it now!

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle
Whoops.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle
Hey...

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle
This isn't a field trip, you know?

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle
That's it!

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle
We got her mad!

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle
Sorry, Mahiro-chan!

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle
Take this! Vanishing pillow!

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle
Keep it down, will you?!

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle
Onimai.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle

ONIMAI

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle
ONIMAI

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle
This is all your fault, Asahi.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle
You were being loud too, you know?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle
Let's just try to keep it down from now on, okay?

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle
Then...

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle
It's finally time for some girl talk!

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle
Oh, you're back with us, Miyo-chan?

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle
Chatting is the best part of a sleepover!

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle
I see.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle
Chatting's not really my thing...

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle
Hey, hey! What do you guys wanna talk about?

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle
Romance, right? It's gotta be romance.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle
Well then, allow me to take the lead.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle
Huh?!

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle
I'll tell you a fearsome tale...

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle
of the Pillow Flipper spirit!

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle
This is a true story of my many encounters with it.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle
Every night, when I'm asleep, 
it appears before my pillow.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle
Pillow, pillow, pillow...

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle
It takes your pillow from under your head,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle
and even moves you around in your sleep.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle
This is girl talk?

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle
That's just a spooky campfire story.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle
Asahi, you dummy!

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle
Why'd you have to bring up such a scary story?!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle
H-Hey now, weren't you listening?

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle
That wasn't scary at all!

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle
La-la-la! I'm not listening!

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle
I didn't think she'd react this badly...

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle
So you already knew she didn't like them?

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle
That's pretty mean, you know?

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle
I'm going to sleep!

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle
I'm sorry!

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle
Aw! What about our romance talk?

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle
Momiji can be pretty cute sometimes too, huh?

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle
I'm turning off the light now!

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle
Okay!

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle
I really need to go to the bathroom...

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle
God, that stupid Asahi!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle
I'll just have to hold it in till morning.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle
So cold...

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle
Where'd my comforter go?

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle
She really is a nightmare to sleep next to...

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle
It's no use! She's sound asleep!

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle
I'm gonna catch a cold at this rate.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle
Welp, I guess it's time for an emergency evac.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle
Momiji...

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper?!

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle
S-Sorry about that. Really.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle
D-Don't beat yourself up about it!

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle
It was my fault, anyway.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle
Just leave the rest to me.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle
You can head back and use my futon instead, okay?

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle
O-Okay...

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle
Where will you sleep, though, Mahiro-chan?

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.540 align:middle
Hmm...

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle
Oh!

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle
Mihari

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle
Wha?! What's going on?

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle
Why are you here?

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle
Please, no questions at this time.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle
Good night!

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle
Wow, this is so embarrassing!

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle
I must have drunk too much before bed, you know?

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle
So that's what happened.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle
Well, you live and you learn.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle
You didn't have to take the blame for me, you know?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle
No worries, I got you.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle
It'll be our little secret.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle
Y-You're sure?

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle
Well, thank you.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle
It's no biggie.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle
Interesting. Very interesting.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle
Wait...

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle
Where's Asahi-chan?

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle
She's still sleeping upstairs.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle
Asahi's never been much of a morning person.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle
The Pillow Flipper strikes again!

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle


00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle
On the count of three:

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.770 align:middle
Venture into our secret garden!

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle
Hey Onii- I mean, Mahiro! Wanna try on a maid outfit?

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle
No, no, no, we're doing a bunny girl costume!

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle
Huh?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle
Let's put on matching dresses!

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle
H-Hold on!

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle
Hey! Stop it!

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.330 align:middle
Either way, take off your clothes!

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle
NOOOOOO!

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle
Ethics rejected, drug perfected

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle
(Something's afoot)

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle
No trace of resistance detected!

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle
(Gone, kaput)

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle
Cutie acquired, cuddling frenzy

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.330 align:middle
(Deary me)

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle
Partner recaptured, time to get busy!

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle
(Teehee)

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle
Let's throw a sleepover, yay, yay, yay

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle
(Mahiro's got himself a harem!)

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle
A night of unbridled girl-on-girl action

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.260 align:middle
(I'm getting kinda turned on)

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle
On the count of three:

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle
Let's get that heart a-throbbin'

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle
One little push is all that's needed

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle
To ease your transition into a new world!

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle
(One! Two! Three!)

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle
(Go bouncy world!)

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle
Fine, whatever, totally beat

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle
Just forget it, surrender complete

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle
Girls contain huge secrets

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle
Within their tiny bodies!

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle
Do your best, go all the way

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle
As your reality starts to fray

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle
Girl power makes the world go round!

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle
My impending identity crisis is officially on hold

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle
Next Episode: Mahiro Rings in the New Year

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle


00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle
See you next time!

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle
