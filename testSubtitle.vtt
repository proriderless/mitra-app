B Komachi

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.040 align:middle
This story is a work of fiction.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.330 align:middle
Actually, most everything in this world is fiction.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.000 align:middle
They fabricate...

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.630 align:middle
exaggerate...

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle
and thoroughly conceal anything inconvenient.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle
That being the case, the idol fan is one
who wants to be skillfully lied to.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle
In this world, lies are weapons.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle
Ai!

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle
I wish I could've witnessed her cuteness in person!

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle
The idol group B Komachi's absolute ace...

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle
Their unshakable center...

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle
The supremely pretty 16-year-old girl...

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle
Ai!

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle
It's been four years since their formation!

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle
They gradually gained popularity,
their media exposure increased,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle
and it feels like the public has
now finally discovered them!

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle
This is where she really takes off!
Her stardom is now close at-

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle
Why are you playing a DVD in a patient's room?

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle
It goes without saying it's rather odd.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle
Observing something beautiful is good for one's health.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle
I mean, it's not like there are any idol concerts
this far out in the countryside.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle
This is a form of medical practice.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle
It's proselytizing, plain and simple.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle
Please don't make it our hospital's official position.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle
Oh, that reminds me, sensei.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle
Just now, it was trending on Twitter that...

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle
WHAT?!

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle
Ai of B Komachi

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle
Goes on Hiatus Due to Poor Health

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle
Ai is going on hiatus?!

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle
You really are a true believer.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle
She's 16, isn't she? I guess you're a lolicon.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle
I only ask you don't call me that.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle
I've got my reasons, okay?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle
I did my residency at this same hospital, you see.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle
In those days, I often slacked off
in patients' rooms same as now.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle
Shape up.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle
Sarina Tendouji

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle
One of the patients I met back then changed my destiny.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle
And this girl is Mei-Mei!

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle
Her dancing is great!

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle
Hmm...

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.040 align:middle
Ari-pyan and Kyun-pan are good singers,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle
but my fave is...

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle
without a doubt Ai!

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle
She's about my age, but she's so grown-up
looking and great at singing and dancing!

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle
And what a pretty face she has...

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle
If I could be reborn, that's the face I want.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle
What's this "reborn" nonsense? Don't be silly.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle
Not much of a dreamer, are you?

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle
Haven't you thought about what it'd be like
if you were born as a celebrity's child?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle
Like, if you had looks and connections right from birth.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle
Nope.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle
So you really don't have any dreams...

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle
You're cute yourself, Sarina-chan.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle
There's no need for you to be reborn.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle
After you're discharged,
become an idol yourself if you want.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle
I'll be your fan if you do.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle
Really?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle
I love you, sensei! Marry me!

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle
Forgive me, but I'd be as good as dead socially.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle
Okay, Mr. Moralist...

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle
A shame, isn't it? But I'll seriously
consider it once you turn 16.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle
Sixteen, huh?

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle
You're a big meanie.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle
It's a practical plan, right?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle
An anaplastic astrocytoma...
She was just 12 years old.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle
If she were still alive today, she'd be 16 just like Ai.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle
I suppose I followed Sarina-chan's favorite idol,
superimposing the two of them in my mind.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle
Her walking the path toward her dreams...

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle
I just want to see that is all.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle
Makes sense.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle
So you're quite the lolicon, after all.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle
Were you even listening?!

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle
That was quite the touching story I recalled!

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle
There's something graphic about
the way you're obsessed with her.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle
Aren't you just using Sarina-chan as
an excuse to release your own desires?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle
Ridiculous! I swear in Sarina-chan's name that
I'm supporting her with the purest of hearts!

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.330 align:middle
But, if that Ai girl appeared and
asked you to date her, wouldn't you?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle
Well, lunch break is over. Let's get back to work.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle
How about it, Sensei? Swearing in the name
of Sarina-chan, what's your answer?

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle
Still, I am worried about Ai... I hope she gets
healthy and makes a comeback.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle
Hello, thank you for waiting.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle
Let's see... So this is your first visit, Hoshino-san?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle
Yes.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle
Judging by her belly, she's about 20 weeks along now.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle
That's rather late for an initial examination.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle
She is 16 years of age... I see,
she must be dealing with some things.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle
Must be one of those girls who gets this
far along without being able to consult anyone.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle
Are you her father?

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle
Well, on paper...

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle
She grew up in a children's home, and
I'm her de facto guardian, or rather her guarantor.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle
Oh, I see.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle
Sixteen, raised in a children's home.
I feel like I've heard this story before.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle
It's just like...

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle
Sensei, how is it looking? Any chance
she just has a terrible case of constipation...?

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle
In that case, she'd be dead already.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle
I'm doin' fine on that front!

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle
No problems today either!

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle
First off, you'll need an examination.
I need to get everything ready, so please wait here.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle
Obstetrics and

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle
Man, is that really her?!

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle
Could she just be a dead ringer for Ai?!

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle
Nah, no way a years-long fan
like myself would be mistaken!

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle
Wow, Ai is super cute in person!

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle
NO!

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle
My favorite idol is pregnant!

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle
It's such a shock I feel like I'm gonna vomit.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle
Ai...

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle
how in the world did this happen?

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle
Yeah, seriously!

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle
As your agency's president, why didn't you consult me?

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle
Who's the father anyway?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle
Well...

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle
that's a secret!

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle
"A secret"?! Well, no point belaboring it, then.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle
The results of the examination are as follows:
20 weeks pregnant, twins.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle
"Twins"?

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle
Twins...

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle
Ai, you serious about carrying them to term?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle
If it gets out that you've become
pregnant at 16 and given birth...

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle
your career and my agency will be finished.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle
What are your thoughts, Sensei?

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle
The final decision rests with you.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle
Really think it through before deciding.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle
As a doctor, that is all I'm able to say.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle
As a doctor... anyway.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle
And now, onto our next story.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle
Ugh, for real?

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle
Surprise

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle
Announcement

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle
Entertainer Ponta and Idol MIU

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle
are married and expecting

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle
Today, popular entertainer Ponta-san and idol MIU-san
held a joint press conference announcing their marriage.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle
Man, I really liked MIU...

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle
Well, that's rather timely...

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle
Wait, if I die now, there's a chance
I'll be reborn as an idol's kid... right?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle
MIU-san is currently five-months pregnant.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle
That's pretty messed up, dude.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle
Still, can you really stan an idol
who's got a husband and kids?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle
Even if you've got a guy you've fallen for,
I'll still keep supporting you.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle
That said, if you give birth to these children, I suspect
I won't be able to see you soar to greater heights.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle
I guess the views of fans are pretty self-centered...

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle
You think so too, don't you, Sarina-chan?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle
Oh, Sensei.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle
Hoshino-san.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle
It's not good for you to be out on a windy night.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle
I'm bundled up, so I'll be fine.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle
I chose this place based on the president's
recommendation, but it sure is lovely!

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.790 align:middle
There are so many stars even at dusk.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle
You could never see this back in Tokyo.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle
Did you come all the way out here to the countryside
because you'd be recognized in Tokyo?

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle
Oh?

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle
Did I mention my work?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle
Long ago, one of my patients was a big fan of yours.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle
Aww... I thought even the doctors here would
be old men and nobody would find me out.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle
Guess there's no hiding my overflowing aura.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle
Awkward, awkward!

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle
Her self-confidence is cute.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle
So, are you gonna give up being an idol?

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle
Why?

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle
No way.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle
But, that means...

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle
I don't have a family, you see.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle
I always longed for one.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle
I'm carrying twins, right?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle
I'm sure our family will be a cheerful and fun one!

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle
You're gonna give birth...

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle
and also continue being an idol.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle
So, that must mean...

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle
Yep, I won't make it public.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle
Idols are objects of worship, you know?

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle
They sparkle through the magic of lies.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle
Lies are the most exquisite love!

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle
Being able to conceal a kid or two just works
to show someone's a top-class idol.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle
Piling on lie after lie, we look happy as we sing on stage
no matter what struggles we might face. What a fun job!

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle
Still... The happiness part's something
that I wanna experience for real.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle
No one realizes it, but we've got
our own feelings and lives, too.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle
Happiness as a mother, and happiness as an idol...

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle
It might be normal to have only one...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle
but I want both!

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle
Ai Hoshino's a greedy girl, you know!

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle
The idol I knew as Ai is far more bold, cunning,
and strong than I ever imagined.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle
She shone as bright as the first start of evening.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle
I've reached a settlement.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle
My views as a doctor and as a fan have now aligned.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle
Ai Hoshino, I will perform the delivery,
ensuring you safely give birth to healthy children.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle
If that's what will make you happy, I'll go along with it.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle
After all, you're hopelessly an idol,
and I am hopelessly your fan.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle
Alright, let's get down to business.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle
As a start, you should use
an assumed name here at the hospital.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle
Okay.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle
In a case like yours, a cesarean section
will likely be necessary.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle
If one of the baby's skulls is large, for someone with your
build it's common for the pelvis to not open enough.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle
Oh, really?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle
A scar on her belly will spell trouble for her job...

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle
Sensei, aren't there other options?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle
Painless delivery, Sophrology... Well...

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle
Whatever's fine. I feel super healthy.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle
Ai...

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.580 align:middle
It'll be fine. I can handle a natural delivery.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle
I mean, they're my kids, right?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle
They're sure to be attractive and have small faces.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle
There you go again...

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle
Perhaps I became a doctor for this very moment.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle
I'll see that they're delivered
as safely and surely as possible.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle
I vow to protect your family.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle
If I'm being honest, I do have mixed feelings.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle
But I've done everything I can to hide that.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle
Lies are love.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle
I've come to see that phrase in
a good light - stars truly are amazing.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle
40 Weeks

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle
Expected Delivery Date

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle
Thanks for today, Sensei.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle
But come back as soon as I call, okay?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle
Sure thing. Besides, I live really close by.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle
Well, if I don't make it,
another doctor will attend to you anyway.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle
No, I want you.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle
I'm just joking. See you later.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.170 align:middle
Okay.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle
Once this is over, I'll lose my connection to Ai...
and we'll go back to just being an idol and her fan.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle
I got a glimpse of her hidden side, but I feel that
I actually came to like her straightforward personality.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.750 align:middle
I feel I can root for her happiness from the bottom of my-

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle
Hey, buddy.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle
Are you Ai Hoshino's doctor?

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle
She's using an assumed name.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle
Even if you spotted her at the hospital, why do you know
her family name, which has never been made public.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle
Are you affiliated with her?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle
Can I get your name?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle
Hey!

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle
Could this guy be a stalker?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle
And his timing, with Ai just about to give birth...

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle
Dammit! Making me rush down
a mountain trail like this...

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle
Where'd he go?!

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle
Ah, he really startled me.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle
I just blanked out all of a sudden.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle
Oh, my phone.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle
Has Ai gone into labor?

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle
Where is my phone anyway?

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle
I can't tell - it's so dark.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle
Er, I can't move a muscle.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle
I've gotta get there ASAP.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle
After all, I promised her. I told her
I'd make sure her babies were born healthy.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle
I need to get up... and ensure her children are...

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle
Haven't you thought about what it'd be like
if you were born as a celebrity's child?

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle
Like, if you had looks and connections right from birth.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle
If I die now, there's a chance
I'll be reborn as an idol's kid...

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle
Surprise

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle
Announcement

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle
Entertainer Ponta and Idol MIU

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle
are married and expecting

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle
Ai's fan for

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle
all eternity!!!

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle
If I could be reborn...

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle
I'd never given it serious thought before.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle
I mean, why would I?

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle
After all, I didn't think it had anything to do with me.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle
Oshi no Ko

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle
I had thought that when a person like me
died they would go to hell...

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle
But...

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle
when I awoke, I was in heaven.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle
This is how I am now.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle
You're such a good boy, Aquamarine.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle
Name: Aquamarine Hoshino

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle
In any case, I'd been given quite a name.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle
Now, I'm living as the son of idol Ai Hoshino.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle
I'm at a loss as for why, though.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle
I mean, it took me quite some time
to accept the reality of the situation.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle
Was I reborn?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle
Well, maybe "reincarnated" is
the more modern way of putting it?

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle
Why do I still have memories from my previous life?

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle
What principle could be at work?

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle
Though I may not look it, I'm still something of a doctor.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle
I intend to eventually uncover
the mechanism behind this.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle
But...

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle
for now, I want to enjoy this life as a baby to the fullest.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle
This environment where my favorite idol
is doing her darnedest to pamper me...

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle
deeply touches the heart of
the tired working adult inside me.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle
Coming!

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle
Oh, right, there's one more person who lives with us.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.830 align:middle
Now what's the matter, Ruby?

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.330 align:middle
Ruby Hoshino: the girl who was born as my twin.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle
Her name is relatively less
psychologically damaging than mine.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle
So much so that even now I wish she'd swap with me.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle
What's wrong, Aqua?

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle
That's Ruby, ya know?

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle
And you call yourself a mother?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle
I've always been bad at remembering
names and faces, so I can't help it.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle
Pretty gross, huh? Japanese men have these
illusions about how mothers should be.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle
Don't get all international on me when
you don't even have a passport!

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle
Besides, you said you won't
go on location overseas, right?!

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle
But, you know, I'm able to the remember the names
of people I think are talented, President Satou.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle
Close... My name is Saitou, you damn idol.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle
Strawberry Productions, Inc.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle
President            Ichigo Saitou

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle
Anyway... as of today, Ai returns to being an idol!

00:17:54.290 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle
Strawberry Productions Meeting

00:17:54.290 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle
Ai's comeback

00:17:54.290 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle
Dealing with the kids

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle
We're gonna discuss your activities going forward.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle
The first step of your comeback
is a music program tonight.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle
It'll be broadcast live, but you're up for it, right?

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle
Of course.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle
While you're working,
my wife will look after your children.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle
I see...

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle
Strawberry Productions, Inc.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle
Miyako Saitou

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle
Your wife is pretty young, huh?

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.380 align:middle
The other members are super turned off
by the way you favor young girls.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle
That's news to me. I'll be more careful.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle
Is it a problem if I bring my kids to the studio?

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle
Of course it's a problem!

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle
Now listen here!

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle
If word gets out that a idol like you became a mother
of two at 16, you can kiss your idol career goodbye.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle
I'll come under fire as the one responsible for
supervising you, and my agency will be finished.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle
The whole lot of us will be going straight to hell!

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle
And no bringing the kids shopping
or to do paperwork at gov offices either!

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle
If you have a truly pressing emergency, you're to head
out under the guise that you are watching our kids for us.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle
Aw, come on!

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle
What a pain, huh, Ruby?

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle
That's Aqua.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle
As a mother, I suppose Ai could
be considered rather hopeless.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle
But, the president and his wife
considerately cover for her.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle
So, things may work out, after all.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle
The rehearsal starts soon. Let's move out.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle
Okay!

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle
Whoops!

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle
That was a close call! I almost flashed
my boobs at you, President.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle
Well, keep 'em covered when you're outside.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle
Nope, she's hopeless, after all!

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle
This girl's so reckless!

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle
B Komachi is coming on!

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle
We're B Komachi! Thanks for having us.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle
Yeah, glad to have you.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle
Aw, I don't have any experience
babysitting in the first place...

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle
Why did it fall on me...?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle
First appearance for Ai of B Komachi

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle
since returning from hiatus!

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle
Unveiling of the eagerly-awaited new song "Sign wa B"

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle
Here's Ai-san,

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle
who has resumed her idol activities as of today!

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle
Doing alright? Are you eating properly?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle
Yes! I'm eating plenty!

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle
That's a relief. She's doing a good job.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle
Oh, right! Speaking of food, the other day my baby...

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle
"My baby"?

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle
Er, I mean my baby kitten!
I got a pet during my rest period, you see!

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle
Oh...

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle
Maybe she really is hopeless.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle
Oh, I'm always blurting out such strange things...

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle
In 30 seconds,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle
the camera will be switching over.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle
Please give us a nice performance!

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle
Sure!

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle
Thanks for your help!

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle
Do you know B Komachi?

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle
Nope. And I'm not interested.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle
I've listened to their recordings,
and they're neither good nor bad, just average.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle
Well, this is the kind of stuff that sells.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle
True.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle
Mass-produced idols...

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle
We've gotta praise them somehow
like it or not - what we gonna do?

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle
That center girl's face is about
the only thing worthy of praise.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle
I do recognize their name, but there's been
no talk of them these past six months.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle
Which side's trying to push them on people?

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle
Probably started as an underground idol group.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle
They're with Strawberry Productions - never heard of 'em.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle
That one with the big boobs is nice.
We should get her to do pinup modeling.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle
Can we ask her out to eat?
She seems like the producer's type.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle
In this industry, lies and self-interest
are concealed behind the smiles.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle
On in 10 seconds

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle
You can't be causing losses for the broadcast.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle
To get the very best performance out of every single
performer, even the staff will lie if need be.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle
That goes for big shots, too.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle
They act like they're making something great,
but they only look at the numbers.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle
On in ten seconds. Eight...

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle
seven, six... On in five seconds.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle
Great, bring it on!

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle
Four! Three!

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle
My Ai is a bona fide liar!

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle
The president sure is a crazy guy.
If Ai's secret is exposed, he risks losing everything...

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle
Still, I get it... There's no way to not go crazy around her.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle
In front of an excessively intense light,
people can but get scorched.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle
They are like moths drawn to the flame.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle
Even upon realizing their wings will
be singed off, they cannot stop.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle
And I'm no exception. I'm glad I'm able
to watch over Ai from so close.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle
So much so that I'm grateful
to that guy who murdered me.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle
Should this rebirth happen to be a miracle brought
about by the many obsessions toward her,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle
it would make total sense to me.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle
Though, the truth is I wanted to help her
give birth to normal children.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle
It's a force majeure.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle
You can't compete against supernatural phenomena.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle
So, I'm going to enjoy myself.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle
Wait!

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle
N Station already started!

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle
Why didn't you wake me up?!

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle
Oh my god, Mama's just too cute!

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle
All the viewers should pay 100 million yen for this!

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle
Her expressiveness when she turns is outta this world!

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle
It's so eerie it's like she's an oni!

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle
Daaamn!

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle
I just had a diaper change but
I feel like I'm gonna wet myself!

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle
She has a great face, great figure,
and her singing is excellent too!

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle
Our mom is seriously a tremendous talent!

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle
I've gotta go back and watch the recording ASAP!

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle
Live broadcasts are best watched in real time,
so why didn't you get me up?!

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle
This body of mine always get so tired,
so let's help each other out!

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.710 align:middle
I woke you up a number of times.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle
Oh, you did?

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle
Dummy

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle
This dummy here is also someone
who's been reborn, same as me.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle
I ended up realizing that quite early on.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle
B Komachi Ai

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle
Emieri JD

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle
She seems to have a bad personality #Ai

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle
Kumaru Yarou

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle
Ai = a selfish girl who wants to stand out

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle
What?! Drop dead!

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle
You ape-men just can't comprehend
Mama's talent and beauty!

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle
From the quality of her performances,
it's clear she's in a different league!

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle
It's inevitable that management would favor her!

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle
I bet you're just an ugly old hag!

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle
die

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle
die die

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle
die die die

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle
die die die die

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle
Take a look in the mirror and say that again, UGGO!

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle
die die die die die

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle
Jeez, I can't believe this!

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle
Think you can hold a candle to Ai?!

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle
She was searching for "B Komachi Ai" and
engaging in fierce flame wars with haters.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle
Can you really beat Ai, a genius idol with the perfect face and figure?!

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle
Hey... do you share the same fate as me?

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle
Huh?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle
That baby just talked!

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle
Gross!

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle
Right back at ya.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle
I deeply feel that...

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle
I truly had wanted to help Ai give birth to normal children.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle
Aw, oh my god! You just record it once and
then can watch it forever - talk about value!

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle
Not a bizarre set of twins like us.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle
Ai... Ai...

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle
You damn liar.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle
How dare you go and make babies!

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle
Why?

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle
Why...?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle
You tricked me!

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle
Aqua.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle
You hungry? Wanna nurse?

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle
Huh? You'd rather not?

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle
You sure like your bottle, don't you?

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle
Just look at you go!

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle
I feel like, as an adult, being breastfed
by an idol would indeed be crossing the line.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle
Coming!

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle
Wanna nurse again?

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle
Now you like breastfeeding, don't you, Ruby?

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.710 align:middle
That little...!

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle
Time for work.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle
Okay!

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle
I'll be back later.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle
See you later!

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle
See you!

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle
Hey, could you show a bit of restraint?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle
Why?

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle
It's simply the law of nature for a daughter
like me to suck her mother's breast.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.040 align:middle
It's a legitimate right that has been granted to me.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle
Well, let me at least ask...
Were you a girl in your previous life too?

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle
Yep.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle
Well, I suppose I can let it slide then.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle
The jealousy of otaku is gross!

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle
Well, ethically speaking, a grown man
breastfeeding is just messed up!

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle
Lucky me, being able to legitimately
savor her boobs, as I was born a girl.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle
From my ethical viewpoint, that's still a no-go.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle
Poor Mama...

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle
It's super creepy that her own kid
is an otaku obsessed with her.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle
Aw, that poor thing. I'll protect her for as long as I live.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.420 align:middle
You're the creepier one, no doubt.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle
I want a diaper change, so go over there!

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle
How'd this become my job...?

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle
I mean, aren't I a company president's wife?

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle
I married him 'cause I thought I'd get
to work with handsome young guys.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle
But the job I've been given is taking care
of a 16-year-old idol's kids?!

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle
Plus she's a single mom - the father's not in the picture!

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle
This shit's too dark!

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle
I didn't get married to be a damn babysitter!

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle
What?

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle
Being able to serve Mama should
bring nothing but happiness.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle
She's not right in the head, is she?

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle
No, I can actually see the validity in what she's saying.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle
Aah, you know, a scandal is
being covered up here, isn't it?

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle
That's it!

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
B Komachi's Ai

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
has a set of

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
illegitimate

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
twins?!

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
Maternity Health-Record Book

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
Suspicious

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
maternity

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
health-record

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
book

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle
If I sold the story to a weekly magazine,
I could be swimming in cash...

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle
I don't give a crap what happens
anymore - I'm gonna do it!

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle
Uh-oh, not good. What's the call? Do we kill her?

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle
Not happening. She's got too much of a size advantage.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle
I was just kidding, but were you actually serious about it?

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle
There's no question that this could
be trouble if we just let it be...

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle
Even so...

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle
What're we gonna do?!

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle
She's snapping tons of pics of
the maternity health-record book!

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.580 align:middle
Actually, I think this presents an opportunity.
I have an idea.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle
With the proceeds I get from selling this, I'll boost
my fave host to the top of the monthly rankings.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle
O wretched girl...

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle
Thy heart's thirst cannot be quenched by champagne.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle
Who's there?!

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.380 align:middle
I-I am a divine messenger.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle
Thy excesses... can no longer be overlooked.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle
A... "divine messenger"?

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle
Wait a minute, that baby just talked... No way!

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle
In thy experience, are mere babes capable of speech?

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle
Believe in me.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle
Well, it's just when you talk about the divine...

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.460 align:middle
I don't believe in that kind of stuff...

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle
Oh, I get it!

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle
This must be a candid-camera thing! Like, some TV show
Ai-san is in where they prank the managers!

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle
Those are totally a thing!

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle
They sure went to a lot of trouble.
There's a camera somewhere around here, right?

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle
Tch... I guess this was too much of a stretch.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle
Now, now, Ruby-chan,
it's dangerous up there on the tab-

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle
Behave thyself! I am an incarnation of Amaterasu.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.040 align:middle
I am what ye call a god.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle
"God"...

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle
Manipulated by prospects of immediate profit,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle
thou art on the verge of abandoning thy destiny.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle
My destiny...?

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle
Ai Hoshino was chosen by the God of Entertainment.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle
Furthermore, those children are twins
who bear a monumental destiny.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle
It is thy destiny to keep guard over them.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.710 align:middle
Thy deeds run contrary to the will of the gods.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle
Should thou not desist, divine punishment
shall be visited upon thee.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle
"Divine punishment"?!

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle
What do you mean that?! In concrete terms...!

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle
In concrete terms? Specifically...

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.250 align:middle
Thou shalt perish.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle
Yes, perish!

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle
No!

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle
That's super concrete!

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle
What... should I do?

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle
It is simply, really.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle
Guard the secret of their mother and us.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:39.460 align:middle
Moreover, dote on these children
and do everything they ask of thee.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle
"Everything"...

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle
Handsome

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle
man

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle
Do thusly, and a second marriage to a
handsome actor is not out of the question.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle
Seriously?!

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.750 align:middle
I'll do it! I'll do whatever is asked of me!

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle
I'll even lick their insoles if need be!

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle
Thou needn't go that far.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle
A second marriage to a handsome guy~

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle
Do you think that was the right call?

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.920 align:middle
At any rate, there is a limit to infants' scope of activities.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle
And now we'll able to go outside.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle
Yay!

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle
You know... that was quite a convincing performance.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle
Did you do theater before?

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle
Nope, this was a first for me.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle
A first? You never put on any plays at school?

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.630 align:middle
Well, I was raised in a bit of an usual place...

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle
Hmm?

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle
I guess it's just talent, then.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.500 align:middle
Maybe you'll be an actress in the future.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle
My future...

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle
I've never given it any thought.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle
I found myself with a little sister.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle
A strange gal who is an idol otaku.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle
That said...

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle
So, Ai-chan... She dances so nimbly!
And her charisma is off the charts!

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:57.960 align:middle
Hmm...

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle
I like Ai-chan the best of anyone in the whole world,

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle
but I like you just about as much, Sensei!

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle
The passion this girl has when she talks about Ai...

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle
is just like yours...

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle
Sarina-chan.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle
What? Did you call for me?

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle
My bad, did I wake you up?

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle
I wasn't calling out to you.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle
If you're gonna sleep, go to your bed.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle
Well, yeah.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle
There's no way he was...

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.540 align:middle
After all, Sarina was my name in my previous life.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle
It has been a few months since
Ai returned to being an idol.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle
Surging in popularity!            New Release

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle
Sign wa B

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle
New Release!!

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle
B Komachi

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle
And, well, the steady rise of B Komachi...

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle
Net Pay

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle
did not materialize.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle
My pay this month is 200,000 yen...

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle
Hey, this agency's so stingy with pay.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle
The single we just put out reached
no. 3 on the Oricon charts, didn't it?

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle
Aren't the middlemen taking too big a cut?

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.790 align:middle
Complaining only just now?

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle
Unlike the big players who do everything from
production to distribution, we're a puny talent agency.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle
You came into this knowing our profits are slim, right?

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.920 align:middle
I've finally realized the world revolves around money.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle
That's quite a depressing realization.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle
Being an idol is fun,

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle
so I wouldn't mind going on like this if were just me.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle
But, I want to send these kids to good schools
and have them take lessons and so on.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle
To give them lots of options, I've gotta sell better
and earn as much as possible, don't I?

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle
As things stand now, I won't be able
to make these kids happy.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle
Aww, I sure wish I'd get some job offers
for commercials or films...

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.710 align:middle
Now, if I were with a major agency...

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle
Well, lay off that pricey ice cream for a start.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle
I'm heading off for my lesson.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle
Be good while Mommy's gone, okay?

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle
Hey, don't idols usually make
like one million yen a month?

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle
Far from it.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle
Wait, they don't?!

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle
Oshi-Dol

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle
Song royalties and TV appearance fees
are split between the members...

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle
Concerts come out in the red
if the merch doesn't sell well.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle
And clothing expenses are deducted from their pay.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle
Only a select handful pull in one million a month.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:34.210 align:middle
What the hell?! The world's beyond saving when
money doesn't reach the people giving it their all!

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle
Oh, I know!

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle
All the otaku could take turns offering
up their livers to Ai, which we'll sell...

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle
That idea of yours is beyond saving...

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.330 align:middle
Cut it out with that post-nuclear-holocaust
view of religion.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle
She sings and dances, and her face is out of this world...

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle
She does lessons and vocal training...

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle
And she's a hard worker who practices
choreography at home at night.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle
B Komachi is one of the better-selling groups, and yet...

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.710 align:middle
Hey, manager!

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle
Why isn't our Ai getting any job offers?!

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle
What crap management!
Put more effort into sales and marketing!

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle
Easier said than done...

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle
In the end, with idol groups
you have a business situation where

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle
dozens of people cluster together only to compete
for jobs with solo entertainers, you see.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:24.500 align:middle
And when they can finally secure jobs
when sold as a set package,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle
if one tries to compete as a solo performer,
there's a high hurdle to clear.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.130 align:middle
Super Popular

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.130 align:middle
Idol Group       Graduation!

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle
Despite graduating from their idol groups
due to a desire to do solo work,

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle
they are tons of ex-idols who,

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle
unable to secure jobs on their own, work at high-end
food and drink establishments in Roppongi

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:42.420 align:middle
or become Minato girls scraping by via getting
paid to go out drinking, you know?

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle
I actually don't know...

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle
Tokyo's a scary place.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle
I do admit that Ai is amazing.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle
But that only extends to within the idol sphere.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle
In the entertainment industry,

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle
you can't make it unless you have something special
that allows you to compete all on your own.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle
A highly profitable job is not one that
requests "somebody from B Komachi" -

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.000 align:middle
it is one that specifically requests Ai.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.380 align:middle
Being first-class as an idol is on its own not enough.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle
Ai-chan, are you feeling a bit down?

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle
You've only just recovered,
so don't push yourself too hard, 'kay?

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:33.040 align:middle
It's nothing like that. It's just I missed lunch
and I'm starving now!

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.830 align:middle
What?! You some big eater all of a sudden?!

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.210 align:middle
Let's go over that last part again.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.000 align:middle
Okay!

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.790 align:middle
I'm not feeling up to this today...

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.040 align:middle
Guess I'll do some egosurfing.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle
Tanujirou

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle
For better or worse, Ai's smile is that of a pro.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle
It's like it lacks human feeling...

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle
I can't fully support her.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle
Hitting me where it hurts...

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.500 align:middle
Congratulations on

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.500 align:middle
the Performance

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.500 align:middle
B Komachi

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle
B Komachi

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle
Ai's fan for

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle
all eternity

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle
A sales promo event! A mini concert!

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle
The kind you need to win a ticket lottery for!

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:10.420 align:middle
This will be my first time truly seeing Mama perform live.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.000 align:middle
Now, listen here.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle
I brought you here since you kept insisting,

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle
but I'm the one who'll take the brunt of it
if the president finds out about this, got it?

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle
B Komachi

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle
Ai's fan for

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle
all eternity

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle
No cheering, running, or speaking!

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle
Put in your pacifiers and behave yourselves, okay?

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle
That's right, Ruby.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.500 align:middle
We absolutely can't do anything that makes us stand out.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.750 align:middle
Anything that gives a whiff of us being connected to Ai is-

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.130 align:middle
I get it, okay?

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle
You saw it too, right?
The way Mama was down in the dumps...

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle
I'm here because I'm worried about her.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle
Please understand I didn't come to have fun.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle
Today, we have three members of B Komachi with us!

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle
B Komachi! Woo-hoo!

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:08.540 align:middle
B Komachi! Woo-hoo!

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle
For better or worse, Ai's smile is that of a pro.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle
It's like it lacks human feeling...

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle
I can't fully support her.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle
They can go and say that... After all, I am a professional.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle
It's like it lacks human feeling...

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle
I can't fully support her.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.500 align:middle
Besides, I don't really get it.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle
You're the ones who want something almost inhuman.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle
I look in the mirror and study it.
I fine tune it to the millimeter.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle
The way I narrow my eyes, the corners of my mouth..

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle
It's all calculated.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.290 align:middle
I'm always putting on the smile that
will please people the most.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle
I am... made up of lies, after all.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle
Goo-goo! Ga-ga! Goo-goo! Ga-ga! Goo-goo! Ga-ga!

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle
What's with those babies?!

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.880 align:middle
They're doing an idol-fan dance!

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.830 align:middle
And with such skill I can't believe they're infants!

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.540 align:middle
You came 'cause you were worried, huh?! Looks to me
like you're enjoying this more than anyone else!

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle
Instinct took over...!

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.500 align:middle
Wow...

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle
What the...? Amazing!

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle
My kids are so cuuute!

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle
Faced with the extraordinary sight of baby twins performing

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle
an idol-fan dance, idol ends up spontaneously reacting

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle
Two hundred ten thousand retweets...

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle
And the reposted video already has two million views.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.000 align:middle
I get that it's easier for content
with babies to go viral, but still...

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.250 align:middle
Let's have a little talk.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle
Anonymous

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle
What's this girl's name?

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle
Anonymous

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle
Wait, did Ai always smile like this?

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle
My impression of her has changed a bit.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle
Anonymous

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle
I get nothing but

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle
"troublesome otaku" vibes from these babies

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle
Tanujirou

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle
This right here! This is it!

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.080 align:middle
Oh, I see...

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle
So this is good, huh?

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.080 align:middle
I'll remember that.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.080 align:middle
One year has passed since then.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:50.420 align:middle
We've grown to the point where it is no longer
suspicious for us to walk around or talk,

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle
and my sister...

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle
Mama! Mama!

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle
Hm?

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.330 align:middle
Pat me!

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.170 align:middle
Pat, pat~

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle
has superbly embodied a zealous fan who clings
to their idol and brands them "Mama."

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle
Aww, Pure Land of Perfect Bliss.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle
Where'd you learn a difficult phrase like that?

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.790 align:middle
Wait, could it be that you...

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle
Well, I...

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle
Could it be that Ai finds us suspicious in...

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle
...are like some kinda super genius?

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle
...no way at all, so we spend peaceful days together.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle
Must be genetic!

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle
From model to radio assistant...

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle
Ai steadily picked up more gigs,

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.920 align:middle
and today she has a job that could be said
to be the crystallization of all that work.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle
Mama, your first TV drama - what fun!

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle
It's only a minor role, though.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.330 align:middle
Now listen here, you two.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle
You kept insisting, so I brought you along,

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle
but make absolutely sure not to
call Ai-san "Mama" on the set, okay?

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle
Don't forget that the story is that you're my kids.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle
Yeah, yeah. Mama, Mama, gimme some head pats.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle
Me too, Mama!

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle
Mama, gimme my allowance.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle
I'm Ai from Strawberry Productions.
I look forward to working with you today.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.710 align:middle
Same to you!

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle
Is something the matter, Director?

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle
No, nothing in particular.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle
Kinda scary, isn't he?

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle
Yeah, that face of his.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.710 align:middle
Hm? Whose kids are these?

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.630 align:middle
Oh, they're my kids.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.880 align:middle
The idea of a manager bringing her kids to the set...

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle
This one of those work-style reform things?

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle
Um?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle
Sign of the times, huh?

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.580 align:middle
Well, some people even bring their dogs these days.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.290 align:middle
Yes, that won't be a problem. Huh?

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle
Hey, we've also got some snacks.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle
So I was found out, huh?

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:53.750 align:middle
My children are very well behaved, you see.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle
I'm on a diet.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.130 align:middle
Twins! How cute!

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.080 align:middle
Oh, if I recall, this girl's a pinup model...

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle
And that one's an young performer who's called
"an adorable actress with real acting chops."

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle
Goo-goo! Ga-ga!

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle
Knock it off with that cutie-pie act.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.710 align:middle
It's no use. My body's giving out.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:12.460 align:middle
Hm?

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.040 align:middle
Oh, you're that manager's kid.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle
I don't mind you being here, but if you cry
and interrupt the filming, I'll kick you out.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.540 align:middle
Oh, we'd never!

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle
Though we may be a babies, we shall strive
to not make any such blunders!

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.290 align:middle
I am well aware that not hindering
the production process is a baseline rule.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.500 align:middle
Please show favor to our agency's Ai going forward.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.670 align:middle
Whoa, this baby sure is talkative!

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.710 align:middle
Where'd you learn all those words?!

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.790 align:middle
Here and there on YouTube...

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle
Man, that YouTube is amazing! Sign of the times, huh?!

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle
I see a good number of precocious child actors,
but you're really something else.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.080 align:middle
You do any acting by chance?

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle
No, acting and such isn't something I...

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.130 align:middle
You'd be interesting up on screen.
I'd like to put you in something.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle
Here's my business card.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.920 align:middle
Give me a call if you sign up with an agency.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle
No, if you're going to hand out work,
then give it to Ai rather than me.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.080 align:middle
Oh, that idol...

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle
She has an exceptional face.
With some luck, she'll survive in the industry.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle
This looks delicious!

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle
She needs luck despite having an exceptional face?

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle
Listen here, kid. There are three types of actors.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle
Look at them over there.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.210 align:middle
One is the star actor.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.460 align:middle
Their primary role is to attract an audience.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle
Given they also act as poster children,
they garner solid performance fees.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle
Next is those with real talent. Their role is
to ensure the quality of the product on screen.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle
Maintaining the programing block's brand is their job.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle
Lastly, you've got newcomer actors.
Acting ability isn't really expected from them.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle
They get a passing mark if they can bring
a sense of freshness to the screen.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.330 align:middle
There's also the goal of giving
the next stars some experience.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.250 align:middle
I suppose it's an investment the entire industry makes.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.880 align:middle
In other words, all those fresh faces over
there are currently being invested in.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.540 align:middle
Unless they either draw in viewers
or become well-liked on set,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle
their places will be taken by the next crop of newcomers.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle
It would be a great success if even one of
the newcomers here today makes it in the industry.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.500 align:middle
That's the kind of world this is.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle
Those who survive are first-class at something or other.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle
Hmm... Well, she'll be fine, then.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.960 align:middle
Ai is a first-class idol.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.880 align:middle
No, even being a first-class idol won't cut it.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle
Director!

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.210 align:middle
We're all ready for the set test.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle
Okay, I'll watch from here.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.460 align:middle
Ready and...!

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.460 align:middle
What're you saying?

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.500 align:middle
Want me to ask Touma-kun for you?

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.170 align:middle
Hey! Don't even think about it!

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle
But aren't you two always together?

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle
Her acting is average...
but she really attracts your attention.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.380 align:middle
Right? She was talking about that earlier.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:52.040 align:middle
Up on stage, I need to look cute for everyone
no matter what angle they view me from,

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle
but here it's only a single person...

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.420 align:middle
I just need the camera to think I'm cute.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle
If the same tricks I use for music videos
will work, it's right in my wheelhouse.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.880 align:middle
Way to go!

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.880 align:middle
I'll be cheering you on, okay?!

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.460 align:middle
She thinks of it like a music video...
Sign of the times, huh?

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle
What?! They're super well-made,
so you should really give them a look!

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle
I'll even lend you the DVDs!

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle
Keep it down, will ya?

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:19.750 align:middle
It's still too soon.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle
It's never too late to take on a challenge.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.420 align:middle
I can't wait to see your performance, Mama!

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.250 align:middle
Well, they did film me quite a bit.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:26.630 align:middle
Here it comes.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.460 align:middle
It's starting!

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:30.790 align:middle
You in a bad mood or something?

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:31.790 align:middle
Not really.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.290 align:middle
Was it something I did?

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle
I said no!

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle
Oh, this is the scene!

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:35.580 align:middle
What is this?

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle
Aww, it's Mama!

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle
Good morning.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.250 align:middle
C'mon, give her a close-up!

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.130 align:middle
Oh, good morning.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.790 align:middle
Huh? Is something wrong?

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:42.380 align:middle
Wait! Touma!

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle
You... Why're you here?

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.380 align:middle
And that's why we weren't supposed to see each other.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.790 align:middle
Um, what do you mean by that?

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle
News

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle
What?! That's all?!

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle
News

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle
Just a bit of a single scene?!

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.130 align:middle
They cut way too much!

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle
I wonder if my acting was bad...

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.130 align:middle
No, it definitely wasn't.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:05.580 align:middle
Yakitori

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.710 align:middle
Yes?

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.920 align:middle
Hey, Director, what's the big idea?!

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle
Oh, hey, precocious baby.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle
You didn't give Ai any screen time!

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.380 align:middle
Yeah, about that...

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle
Her part came out great, so it's quite a shame.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle
Well, why then?!

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle
The lead actress's agency promotes her as
"an adorable actress with real acting chops."

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.210 align:middle
So how's it look when a girl with
an even prettier face is sharing the screen?

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.710 align:middle
It'd be a problem for their image strategy, right?

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle
Ai simply appeared too cute up on screen.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:42.290 align:middle
And so, word came down from the top to cut her
out as much as possible during editing.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle
Good grief...

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:48.000 align:middle
The screen time a performer receives tends to be
decided by the power balance between companies,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.960 align:middle
so just see it as an unexpected misfortune and accept it.

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle
I can't accept it.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.000 align:middle
It's fine to dream of the entertainment industry,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.170 align:middle
but it's best not to have illusions
about the entertainment industry.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.380 align:middle
This isn't a place for art, but rather one for business.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.830 align:middle
But that said, I understand your point,
and I feel bad about this.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.580 align:middle
Mama, I know you did your very best!

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.040 align:middle
I hesitate to say "in exchange,"
but I'd like to offer Ai another job.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.290 align:middle
I suppose I did.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:15.790 align:middle
For a film, that is.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle
Can't complain about that, right?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.880 align:middle
Seriously?!

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.920 align:middle
On the condition that...

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.500 align:middle
you also appear in the film.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle
Listen up, Precocious Baby.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.500 align:middle
In Japan, casting is for the most part
decided upon by the higher-ups.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.960 align:middle
The bigger the budget for a project,
the less it can afford to flop.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.830 align:middle
In order to secure actors who are sure to draw viewers,

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.670 align:middle
the higher-ups have their own battles to fight.

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:45.630 align:middle
The directors with casting authority are
the very select few super heavyweights

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:49.210 align:middle
or those working on low-budget small-scale films.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.080 align:middle
So, which do I look like to you?

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.960 align:middle
Uh... a super-heavyweight direct-

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.750 align:middle
Swing and a miss.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.580 align:middle
We're on the set of a low-budget film here.

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle
Director, thank you for taking care of Aqua today.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:08.250 align:middle
No, not at all. And we're on
the same page about that matter, right?

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle
Er, yes... Aqua has joined
Strawberry Productions as of this month.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.420 align:middle
The thing is, there'll be hell to pay if I use
a kid who's not affiliated with an agency.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.380 align:middle
In terms of acting, I feel like my sister
is probably better than me.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.170 align:middle
Nope, it's you I want.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.580 align:middle
It's in exchange for your performance
that I'm giving Ai a part.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle
In the industry, we call this bartering.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.880 align:middle
It's one of the fundamentals, so keep it in mind.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.580 align:middle
Bartering Ai-san for her own son...

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:38.250 align:middle
That stern-looking director has taken
quite a liking to you, Aqua-san.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:41.130 align:middle
What in the world did you do to make this happen?

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.500 align:middle
Nothing all that special.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.670 align:middle
Old guys for some reason tend to enjoy it when
young people have a casual attitude with them,

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.040 align:middle
so I don't act pompously toward him is all.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.080 align:middle
You're one dreadful baby...

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:58.250 align:middle
My work saw me often interacting with seniors,
so I know how to deal with old folks.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.040 align:middle
I never thought that strange skill
would prove useful now...

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle
Costumes

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle
are in here

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:06.460 align:middle
Mama! Mama! I wanna go back to Mama!

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle
Why isn't Mama here?

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.750 align:middle
Because Ai doesn't film the same days I do.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.630 align:middle
I wanna go home and snuggle up to her!

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:15.830 align:middle
I wanna be held to Mama's breast and pampered!

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle
Isn't she embarrassed to
be acting like that at her age?

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.380 align:middle
Not that I know how old she really is inside...

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.710 align:middle
This is a professional worksite, you know!

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.210 align:middle
If you came to play, head home right now!

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.040 align:middle
Um...

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.170 align:middle
Kana Arima. I'm an actress in the film.

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.330 align:middle
Oh, isn't she...?

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:38.210 align:middle
Hmm, what was it again?

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle
The genius child actor who can lick baking soda like that.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.920 align:middle
Baking Soda

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.920 align:middle
The genius child actor who can lick baking soda like that

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.210 align:middle
The genius child actor who can cry in ten seconds flat!

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle
The much-talked about                                                       Tokyo

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle
quick-crying child actor

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle
Noteworthy

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle
The genius child actor who can cry in ten seconds flat

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.500 align:middle
Everybody says the way I cry in dramas is amazing!

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:49.130 align:middle
Because it is amazing!

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle
You know, I don't really like this girl.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.250 align:middle
Like, she seems fake, and
I have an instinctive distaste for her.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.750 align:middle
There are some people who are
unusually hard on child actors...

00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle
Like you, for example.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:02.960 align:middle
I know about you! You're that kid who had an in.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:09.710 align:middle
That Was The Start

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.630 align:middle
Back when we did the script reading, you
and that idol weren't even part of the story...

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle
Even Mama said the director forced it through!

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.330 align:middle
That's simply not acceptable, okay?!

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.420 align:middle
Well, that's not really...

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:19.080 align:middle
I watched the drama the director shot recently,
and that idol hardly had any screen time at all.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.960 align:middle
I bet her acting was so horrible
they were forced to cut her parts.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.420 align:middle
Seems the one thing she's good
at is buttering people up!

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:31.130 align:middle
Hey, AD, carry my bag.

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.630 align:middle
Um, well, hold on just a minute...

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.170 align:middle
Aqua...

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.880 align:middle
I know, but she's just a kid...

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle
I won't kill her.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.290 align:middle
The rough outline of the film's plot is that

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.540 align:middle
a woman with zero confidence in her appearance

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.670 align:middle
for some reason goes to a sketchy hospital deep
in the mountains to get plastic surgery.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.790 align:middle
Okay, let's shoot it!

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.000 align:middle
Yes, sir!

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:58.460 align:middle
We play the role of creepy children
she encounters at the entrance to that village.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.330 align:middle
Greetings, visitor.

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.080 align:middle
We welcome you...

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.920 align:middle
Now, please do stay for a while.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:13.540 align:middle
Huh? You're the reception party?

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:12.210 align:middle
That's a genius child actor for you - she's great.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.420 align:middle
Do you have an issue with us being children?

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle
Even if I do the same thing, it will be too terrible
to watch given the difference in ability.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.130 align:middle
Even a rank amateur like me understands that much.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.210 align:middle
So, what should I do?

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle
Entrance to the village: creepy children turn up

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle
Child A: "Greetings, visitor. We welcome you...

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle
Now, please do stay for a while."

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle
Risa: "Huh? You're the reception party?"

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle
Child A: "Do you have an issue with us being children?"

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.920 align:middle
Well, the standard answer is that
I should act like a creepy kid...

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.000 align:middle
But that's not what he wants from me, is it?

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.960 align:middle
The visual the director is after is surely...

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.630 align:middle
There's only a single lodging in this village.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:40.920 align:middle
Once you check in, you might enjoy
taking a stroll around the village.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:44.670 align:middle
This scene is one that was added in haste...

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.630 align:middle
After the director met me, he revised
the screenplay with me in mind.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.040 align:middle
If my aim is to intuit his intent,
it's actually better I don't even act.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.040 align:middle
It's sufficient if I just respond to the intent of his direction.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.540 align:middle
He never put it into words,
but what the director wants to say is...

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.500 align:middle
Even without any acting, you're plenty creepy already.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.250 align:middle
Well then, if you will follow me.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000 align:middle
Cut! That'll do!

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:18.630 align:middle
That's good stuff.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.830 align:middle
He was just being himself, huh?

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle
You're amazing! You sent a chill down my spine.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.040 align:middle
Really? That's good to hear.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.250 align:middle
Nothing good about it.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.380 align:middle
Clear out anything in that camera's frame!
We're gonna shoot the start of the next scene.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.170 align:middle
Yes, sir!

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.380 align:middle
Director, reshoot the scene.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.790 align:middle
Hm? But there aren't any problems with it.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.540 align:middle
There's a huge problem!

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.670 align:middle
Just now I...

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.000 align:middle
wasn't nearly as good as that boy.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle
I can't take it! One more time!

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle
I'm begging you!

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.960 align:middle
This time I promise I'll do better!

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:01.420 align:middle
One more time!

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.290 align:middle
Kana-chan!

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:02.830 align:middle
Please!

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.000 align:middle
Hey, Precocious.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.080 align:middle
What do you think is the most
essential element for an actor?

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle
Hmm... ability or a feel for acting?

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.420 align:middle
Drive and effort?

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle
That Was The Start

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.000 align:middle
Well, that stuff is important, too.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.830 align:middle
But in the end, it's communication skills.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle
If fellow actors or staff take a disliking to you,
your job prospects will soon dry up.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.920 align:middle
If you get a swollen head while still young
and act like a big shot, you have no future.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:36.790 align:middle
Were you trying to rake her over the coals?

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle
I wasn't thinking anything patronizing like that.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.040 align:middle
But this sort of thing is nourishment to grow.

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle
Your acting today... was exactly how I envisioned it.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.710 align:middle
That girl was more impressive than me.
I was just being the way I always am.

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:57.460 align:middle
Even so, I never once instructed you to do that.

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.080 align:middle
Reading someone's intentions
is one part of communication skills.

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:04.710 align:middle
Acting with an understanding of the direction
and intent is of course fundamental for an actor.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:09.630 align:middle
But precious is the actor who can even
read intent that can't be put into words.

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:14.000 align:middle
After all, the correct visual is something
we directors possess in our minds.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:20.920 align:middle
Rather than one who does amazing acting,
become an actor who can act just as envisioned.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.630 align:middle
Er, I'm not going to become an actor...

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:32.420 align:middle
And thus, I dipped my toes into the industry.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle
Creepy Child A

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle
Creepy Child B

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle
Kana Arima

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle
Aqua

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.880 align:middle
So he has a proper stage name...

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle
"Aqua."

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.540 align:middle
I won't forget it.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.710 align:middle
Next time, you won't get the best of me.

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle
That Was The Start nominated for Demure Director's

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle
Prize/Best Screenplay. Taishi Gotanda: "I want to prove

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle
it's possible to shoot an entertaining film on a low budget."

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle
Three years have passed since I was reborn as Ai's child.

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.420 align:middle
The film the director shot was reasonably well received,

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle
and he was nominated for the
Director's Prize at some awards ceremony.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.750 align:middle
Looking back on it, I think my acting was quite skilled.

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:07.380 align:middle
However...

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle
in the end it was Ai was who carried the entire film.

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle
I don't know if that was the springboard,
but she landed a lot more work.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:25.330 align:middle
To sum up Ai now, she's a major up-and-coming
idol/media personality... I would venture to say.

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle
Riveted by her

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle
cute eyes!

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle
Idol Group

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle
"B Komachi"

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle
Ai

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.540 align:middle
Ai's

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.540 align:middle
Prank

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.540 align:middle
Successful!

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle
Ai will soon be turning 20.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:34.710 align:middle
Thus far, we have been able to go about our daily lives
without being uncovered by the public.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.920 align:middle
And also...

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle
Gorou Amemiya Doctor Disappearance

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle
Nagoya Houmon Clinic is an environment where young

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle
doctors can develop

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle
Let us take young doctor Ichirou Amemiya as an example.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:41.130 align:middle
my corpse has not yet been found.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle
Hmm, you're looking cute again today!

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle
Super cute!

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.170 align:middle
Well, you're cuter overall, Mama.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:50.460 align:middle
What's with this rivalry?

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.460 align:middle
We enrolled in a preschool.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle
That reminds me, what were
you doing before you were reborn?

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.710 align:middle
And how old are you really, anyway?

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.750 align:middle
Let's see...

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.210 align:middle
If I was younger than he was...

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.040 align:middle
What the heck? Should've figured you were just a kid.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.500 align:middle
From now on you better listen to everything I say, junior.

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:14.000 align:middle
I-I'm an adult woman, okay?!

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.750 align:middle
Asking about a woman's age...
What an insensitive brat you are!

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.630 align:middle
Besides, who cares about my previous life?!

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.170 align:middle
Quit prying!

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.420 align:middle
Well, I suppose you're right.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.500 align:middle
I feel depressed whenever
I think about my previous life...

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.250 align:middle
That's how much I've come to like my current life.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.460 align:middle
Compared to my days at a demanding job,

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.830 align:middle
Natsuhiko Kyogoku

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.830 align:middle
Jorogumo no Kotowari

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:40.500 align:middle
as a preschooler I just eat, sleep, and read books
and such as I please - it's an easy gig.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle
That said, it's really something
how seriously that girl is able to play...

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:49.330 align:middle
Huh? A preschooler is reading one
of Natsuhiko Kyogoku's tomes...

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.000 align:middle
Okay, everyone, it's time for your dance routine.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:57:00.880 align:middle
Make sure to clean up

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.420 align:middle
It won't be long before your families
come watch your dance...

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.880 align:middle
so let's practice hard today!

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:02.420 align:middle
Yes, ma'am!

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.380 align:middle
Peach

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.460 align:middle
No! I won't do it!

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:07.250 align:middle
Ah, Ruby-chan?!

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:12.790 align:middle
Why'd you run away?

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:15.540 align:middle
Because I'm bad at dancing.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.250 align:middle
Or rather, I've never done it before.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.210 align:middle
Hm?

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.830 align:middle
Did you always stay cooped up
in your room and play there?

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.130 align:middle
Kids these days, I tell ya...

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.920 align:middle
I guess I was similar to a shut-in.

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.670 align:middle
I tried several times but could never do it.

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:55.040 align:middle
I don't feel I'm capable of real exercise.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:01.210 align:middle
I don't know what things were like for you before...
but are you really okay with this?

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:05.290 align:middle
You've got a long life ahead of you.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.830 align:middle
Oh? Dance practice?

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.630 align:middle
How about I dance together with you?

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.460 align:middle
We'll be performing an old song at
our next concert, so I've gotta practice.

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.540 align:middle
Mama, your choreography is a bit off!

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:45.080 align:middle
Huh?

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:48.790 align:middle
At your Budokan performance, your hand was higher.

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:52.420 align:middle
Oh? So you watched my concert video?

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.710 align:middle
I'm impressed you still remember!

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.420 align:middle
Of course I do.

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.290 align:middle
I've seen videos of Mama's concerts hundreds...
no, thousands of times.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.790 align:middle
I remember every last bit of the choreography, too.

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.580 align:middle
How'd it go again?

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.420 align:middle
At this part, you went high-

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:10.790 align:middle
You okay?

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:11.500 align:middle
Yeah.

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:16.830 align:middle
Ruby, with the way you move...
it's like you're ready to fall at anytime.

00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.500 align:middle
Well...

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:24.040 align:middle
I was falling over all the time...

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:27.710 align:middle
If I didn't brace myself, I'd get hurt.

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:37.420 align:middle
If you're scared of falling over, you'll just fall even more.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.960 align:middle
Stand more confidently, with your chest out.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.750 align:middle
You'll be fine.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:45.540 align:middle
Trust your mama, okay?

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.880 align:middle
My life came to an end with
the majority of it spent in hospital rooms.

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:57.330 align:middle
My body was disabled, and
it mostly didn't do what I told it to.

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:01.040 align:middle
Lying in bed, I kept longing for it so bad...

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.040 align:middle
Mama's cool moves...

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.330 align:middle
are all etched into my brain.

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:09.250 align:middle
All of that light...

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.630 align:middle
is burned into my retinas.

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:13.920 align:middle
O my light...

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.500 align:middle
If only I could move like that...

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.170 align:middle
If only I could be so free...

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.170 align:middle
More!

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.500 align:middle
Move more!

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.540 align:middle
My body!

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:38.290 align:middle
Ah, it's okay for me to dance, too!

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:44.130 align:middle
So this girl...

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.540 align:middle
isn't only good at acting, huh?

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.880 align:middle
She has a sense for dance...

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.960 align:middle
and good looks she got from our mother.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.210 align:middle
I've just had a scary thought.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:05.130 align:middle
On a whim, I decided to contact
the guy I'd broken up with.

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle
You know, our kids have gotten pretty big.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.460 align:middle
Wanna try meeting them?

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.250 align:middle
No, I'm not trying to get back together
or anything like that.

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:20.040 align:middle
What led to it was overhearing
a convo the kids were having.

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.630 align:middle
I try my best not to think about it...

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000 align:middle
but I do wonder just who our father is.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.290 align:middle
Just thinking about it makes my heart sink.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:30.290 align:middle
You dummy.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.830 align:middle
You let a little thing like that get you down?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.420 align:middle
She obviously had a virgin conception, right?

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.750 align:middle
There was never any guy in the first place.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:42.000 align:middle
She came to this odd conclusion,
and I thought, "Uh-oh, not good."

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:47.130 align:middle
Our kids are super smart -
I'm sure they'll understand our situation.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.710 align:middle
Sure, so our new address is...

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:51.830 align:middle
Ah, it's Ai!

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.500 align:middle
Let's grab a pic!

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.380 align:middle
You sure do love Ai, don't you?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.000 align:middle
My work is going well.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.960 align:middle
Ai

Following                                                                                     Followers

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.540 align:middle
And I have over a million followers now.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.420 align:middle
The world is watching me.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.210 align:middle
Man, this is some good booze!

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.170 align:middle
Come on, celebrate your new digs with a drink!

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:11.290 align:middle
Drink up, drink up!

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.630 align:middle
Wow, that's a Moriizo!

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:14.880 align:middle
Not so fast.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.500 align:middle
Moriizo

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:17.790 align:middle
Ai-san doesn't turn 20 until next week.

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:19.540 align:middle
Please wait just a bit longer.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.040 align:middle
Ah, you're right - got me there!

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.170 align:middle
The widely-popular TV drama starring B Komachi's
Ai-san reached a peak viewership of 14.2% this week.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle
Feature Segment

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle
TV drama starring B Komachi's Ai

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle
records peak viewership of 14.2%

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:27.580 align:middle
The TV drama Ai stars in is climbing up in the ratings!

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.420 align:middle
And B Komachi's work schedule is packed, too!

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.580 align:middle
Next week, we're finally performing at a dome!

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:36.330 align:middle
He's certainly in a good mood.

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:41.540 align:middle
Well, it was always the president's dream
to have an idol he nurtured make it to a dome.

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.500 align:middle
Well, all us staff share that dream, too.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920 align:middle
Are domes really that special?

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:49.710 align:middle
They carry a different connotation
compared to other venues.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:53.710 align:middle
Moreover, you can't even book a slot without
going through a specialized company.

01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:57.540 align:middle
Merch Shop

01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:57.540 align:middle
End of line

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.920 align:middle
The proficiency and track record of staff who
are able to manage a huge number of spectators...

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.250 align:middle
And there's a rigorous screening process
to see if an artist is suitable for the dome.

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:06.040 align:middle
They're venues that require a big time
commitment and lots of staff labor.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.830 align:middle
Simply having money doesn't
mean one can perform there.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.830 align:middle
They're stages onto which only a chosen few can climb.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.630 align:middle
Domes are what everyone dreams of.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.330 align:middle
I see...

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:19.630 align:middle
When I sell well, everyone is pleased.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.580 align:middle
So I'll put on the appearance of being happy, too.

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.080 align:middle
This is an important period!

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.040 align:middle
Be sure not to have any scandals!

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.330 align:middle
Please don't try to meet up with their father, you hear?

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:30.540 align:middle
Of course.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.330 align:middle
I'm a liar.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.080 align:middle
Before even thinking, I say whatever fits the situation.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.420 align:middle
Even I can't distinguish my real feelings from the lies.

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:42.040 align:middle
Mama, pat me.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.250 align:middle
Pat, pat~

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.080 align:middle
Since long ago, I've always
been bad at loving something.

01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:52.630 align:middle
You don't need to do anything to try to make me happy.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:56.250 align:middle
I'd thought I couldn't possibly be suited to be an idol.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.250 align:middle
After all, so long as you're here beside me...

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.670 align:middle
You said you were a scout, so I was wondering...

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.170 align:middle
An idol? Me?

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:03.880 align:middle
What a laugh!

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:09.380 align:middle
My agency is just now putting together
a unit featuring middle-school models, you see.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.880 align:middle
I think you'd have a good shot at becoming the center.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:13.290 align:middle
Not interested.

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.790 align:middle
Come on, you'd be perfect for it. I guarantee it.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.330 align:middle
I think you'd better forget all about it.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.210 align:middle
Besides, I've grown up in an children's home.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:26.920 align:middle
I only had a single parent from the start,
then my mom got arrested for theft when I was little.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.670 align:middle
So I was put in a home while she was away.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:34.630 align:middle
But, my mom never came and
picked me up after her release.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.790 align:middle
I thought if I frightened him a bit, the scout would leave.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.880 align:middle
Well, it's fine, though.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.170 align:middle
I mean, the children's home is better than getting hit.

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:48.750 align:middle
I have no memory of ever
loving someone or being loved.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.710 align:middle
Someone like that could never be an idol, right?

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.080 align:middle
The impression of idols was...

01:04:55.670 --> 01:05:00.460 align:middle
pure beings who flash smiles and
bring smiles to everyone's faces.

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:04.380 align:middle
The polar opposite of me, a people-hating liar.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:08.040 align:middle
I'm sure I wouldn't be able to love the fans.

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.960 align:middle
And they wouldn't love me either.

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:11.420 align:middle
But isn't that fine?

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:15.710 align:middle
It's not a job normal folks are suited for in the first place.

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.710 align:middle
Your background gives you individuality.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.000 align:middle
B-but...

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000 align:middle
Idols say stuff like "I love all of you."

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.500 align:middle
If I said that, I'd be ly-

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.960 align:middle
Lying is fine.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.040 align:middle
In fact, pretty lies are what fans want.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.000 align:middle
Lying is a talent, you know.

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:32.670 align:middle
It's all good. Go on and lie up a storm!

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.330 align:middle
That's really alright?

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.040 align:middle
Even if it's a lie...

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.210 align:middle
it's okay to say, "I love you"?

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.920 align:middle
Isn't the truth that you actually do want to love people?

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.420 align:middle
It's just that you don't know how.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.580 align:middle
You just never find the right object for your love.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.960 align:middle
If you sing and dance while looking cute,
that on its own is an expression of love to the fans.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:02.290 align:middle
If you become an idol, phrases like
"I love you" will appear all over your lyrics.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:08.830 align:middle
Plus, as you continue saying "I love all of you"
the lie might become the truth.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.080 align:middle
"The lie... might become the truth."

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:17.210 align:middle
Hearing those words, I decided to become an idol.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.290 align:middle
I wanted to love someone.

01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:22.380 align:middle
I wanted an object for my love.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.420 align:middle
I thought if I became an idol, I'd be able to love my fans.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.290 align:middle
I wanted to say "I love you" and have
it come from the bottom of my heart,

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.170 align:middle
so I said the lie of "I love you" all over the place.

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.000 align:middle
I thought that if I became a mother,
I'd be able to love my children.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:43.670 align:middle
But I have not yet once told my children I love them.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:49.040 align:middle
If I were to utter those words
and realize I was in fact lying...

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.080 align:middle
The thought of it scares me.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.420 align:middle
That's why today I will once again lie...

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.420 align:middle
believing the lies will become the truth.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.170 align:middle
Even if I end up paying for it one day...

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.500 align:middle
Cancel

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.500 align:middle
I'm excited for today's

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.500 align:middle
dome concert~~

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.210 align:middle
Could that be the president and co.?

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.210 align:middle
Coming!

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.830 align:middle
Congrats on your dome concert.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.710 align:middle
How are your twins?

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:10.330 align:middle
Does that hurt?!

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:10.830 align:middle
Ai!

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:12.580 align:middle
I was hurt worse!

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.790 align:middle
It was incredibly painful!

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.420 align:middle
You went and had kids even though you're an idol!

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.500 align:middle
You fan-betraying slut.

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:18.500 align:middle
Ai! Ai!

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.330 align:middle
You treated us fans like we didn't exist!

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.460 align:middle
I bet you mocked us behind our backs!

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.580 align:middle
You damn liar!

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:26.420 align:middle
You lured us in with your constant
"I love you! I love you!" crap!

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.170 align:middle
It was all lies!

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:31.630 align:middle
I've been irresponsible from the start...

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:36.080 align:middle
I'm not pure, and I'm dishonest and dirty.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.210 align:middle
I don't have a good grasp of
what it means love someone...

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.500 align:middle
So, instead...

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:46.790 align:middle
I told pretty lies that would please everyone...

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:51.540 align:middle
always hoping that one day those lies
would become the truth.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.130 align:middle
I tried my best, worked hard,
and lied with everything I had.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040 align:middle
To me, lies are love.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.080 align:middle
And in my own way, I thought I was expressing love.

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:08.130 align:middle
I don't know if I was able to love you and the others...

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.460 align:middle
but I sang all those love songs
while thinking that I wanted to.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.580 align:middle
Hoping that someday that would be the truth.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.750 align:middle
Even now, I want to love you.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.500 align:middle
Liar...

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.420 align:middle
You don't even remember me, do you?

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:29.960 align:middle
You just want me to let you go, ri-

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.500 align:middle
You're Ryousuke-kun, aren't you?

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.830 align:middle
You often came to the handshake events.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:35.920 align:middle
Oh? Am I wrong?

01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:39.960 align:middle
Sorry, I was never very good with names.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.420 align:middle
I was happy when I got that
star sand from you as a present.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.420 align:middle
I've still got it displayed in my living room.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.880 align:middle
What the hell? I...

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:53.080 align:middle
That's not what...!

01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:58.040 align:middle
Just get over here right now!

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:00.960 align:middle
Ai!

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:02.630 align:middle
I've called an ambulance!

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.580 align:middle
Well, I let my guard down there.

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:09.170 align:middle
So door chains are for times like this, huh?

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.710 align:middle
They never taught us that back at the home.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:13.670 align:middle
Don't try to speak!

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:14.670 align:middle
The bleeding...

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.130 align:middle
It's her abdominal aorta? Shit!

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.500 align:middle
I'm sorry. This is probably...

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.250 align:middle
it for me.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:29.960 align:middle
Are you alright?

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.790 align:middle
You're not hurt, are you, Aqua?

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:34.920 align:middle
No, I'm not.

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.080 align:middle
I wonder if today's dome concert will be canceled...

01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:44.040 align:middle
I feel sorry for everyone.

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.750 align:middle
The movie schedule had been finalized, too.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.040 align:middle
Apologize to the director for me.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.210 align:middle
Hey, what's wrong?

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:56.170 align:middle
What's going on over there?

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.880 align:middle
Stay back, Ruby.

01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.460 align:middle
Tell me!

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.040 align:middle
Ruby?

01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:08.210 align:middle
Your dance at your preschool event... was wonderful.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:15.330 align:middle
You know, I was thinking that maybe
you'll become an idol one day, too.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.710 align:middle
Mother and daughter performing together...

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:20.880 align:middle
Sounds fun, doesn't it?

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.420 align:middle
Aqua, will you be an actor?

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:28.790 align:middle
I wonder... what kind of adults you'll grow up to be...

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.130 align:middle
Aw, I'd like to see you with your school backpacks...

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.880 align:middle
And on parents' day...

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.830 align:middle
I want people to say, "Isn't she
a bit young to be Ruby's mother?"

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.080 align:middle
As the two of you grow up... I want to be there to see it.

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:51.750 align:middle
Not that I was the best mom or anything...

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.210 align:middle
but I'm glad I gave birth to you.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.670 align:middle
And, also...

01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:01.290 align:middle
Ah, I gotta tell you this.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.750 align:middle
Ruby...

01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:05.790 align:middle
Aqua...

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:08.290 align:middle
I love you.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:13.080 align:middle
Ah, I was finally able to say it.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.420 align:middle
I'm sorry... it took me so long.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.880 align:middle
I'm so relieved.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.830 align:middle
Those words definitely weren't a lie.

01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:30.630 align:middle
Ai...?

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.040 align:middle
Ai...?

01:12:56.290 --> 01:13:00.130 align:middle
Ai-san from the idol group B Komachi
has been murdered.

01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.960 align:middle
B Komachi's Ai (20) dead after

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.000 align:middle
being stabbed in abdomen.

01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:06.790 align:middle
Before dawn this morning, a report came in from
her Tokyo condo that "A man is stabbing a woman."

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.830 align:middle
The suspect is a university student

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:07.670 align:middle
in Tokyo who is thought to be her fan.

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.500 align:middle
When the police rushed over,

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.710 align:middle
they found a woman thought to be Ai-san
who had been stabbed in her abdomen

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:14.380 align:middle
and had collapsed and was bleeding.

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:17.540 align:middle
She was then pronounced dead
at the hospital she was transported to.

01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:22.210 align:middle
The man thought to be the culprit
is an enthusiastic fan of Ai-san.

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:26.830 align:middle
Several hours after the incident he made a suicide
attempt and was pronounced dead at a hospital.

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:27.170 align:middle
B Komachi's Ai-san (20)

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.210 align:middle
According to the Metropolitan Police,
Ai-san had just recently moved,

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:35.250 align:middle
and they are looking into the possibility that the man had
an accomplice as they proceed with the investigation.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:41.540 align:middle
B Komachi

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:40.420 align:middle
It has been announced that her planned
dome concert has been canceled,

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.250 align:middle
and in front of the venue numerous fans
have given themselves over to grief.

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:46.500 align:middle
Ai's fan for

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:46.500 align:middle
all eternity

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:51.920 align:middle
The sensational news that an idol had been murdered
by her fan after which the culprit committed suicide

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:54.830 align:middle
broke before even an hour had passed.

01:13:55.710 --> 01:13:59.420 align:middle
The public's response was largely sympathetic.

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:05.630 align:middle
The darkness of the man

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:05.630 align:middle
who killed Ai of B Komachi

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:01.960 align:middle
However, just as I had feared,

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:06.420 align:middle
there were some who treated the deceased like
a plaything and sought to attract attention to themselves.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.540 align:middle
The problem is how lax stalking regulations are

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.540 align:middle
She's a victim of new administration always being too late

If so, it's hardly surprising

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.040 align:middle
she got stabbed to death

01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:16.380 align:middle
What's do you mean "hardly surprising"?

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.250 align:middle
If so, it's hardly surprising

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.250 align:middle
she got stabbed to death

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:17.250 align:middle
Well?!

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:21.000 align:middle
If an idol gets a romantic partner, it's hardly
surprising if she's murdered?! Huh?!

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.540 align:middle
That's a bunch of crap!

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:28.670 align:middle
You go and fall totally in love with idols!
So isn't it selfish to say idols can't fall in love?!

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.290 align:middle
You're just taking out your anger about
not having a girlfriend on women!

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:33.750 align:middle
You're disgusting! Die!

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.080 align:middle
Why is the internet like this?

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.920 align:middle
Mom is dead, and now there's all
this stuff that makes me wanna die...

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:46.540 align:middle
So if you're famous, people can
say whatever they want about you?

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.960 align:middle
What's this "the price of fame" crap?

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:53.330 align:middle
You say stuff like "the customer is king"... but
that line isn't meant to be used by you bastards!

01:14:53.540 --> 01:15:02.420 align:middle
Don't use the words said by hurt people
to satisfy themselves... as an excuse to hurt others.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.460 align:middle
Once three days had passed,
the content surrounding Ai's death had run its course.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.920 align:middle
And after the news turned to a slightly
early snow paralyzing the transport network,

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.170 align:middle
the topic wasn't brought up again.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.710 align:middle
It was as if the snow... was covering up Ai's death.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:26.170 align:middle
As for us, it seems the president and
his wife had transferred us to their family register,

01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:29.920 align:middle
Traffic Division

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:29.420 align:middle
so we never became front-and-center news.

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:33.670 align:middle
Considering that the culprit was
already dead and my own age,

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.960 align:middle
the police's questioning of me
was limited to simple matters,

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.210 align:middle
but the victim counseling went on for quite some time.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.250 align:middle
Would you consider becoming my children for real?

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:48.790 align:middle
Of course, Ai-san will always be your only mother,

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.040 align:middle
and you don't need to think of me as your mother...

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:56.880 align:middle
But, I do think of you two as my own children.

01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:58.580 align:middle
How about it?

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.830 align:middle
Moriizo

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.540 align:middle
Mama said... that maybe I would become an idol.

01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:25.830 align:middle
Do you think I have what it takes to be one?

01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:27.880 align:middle
It's no use becoming one anyway, right?

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:31.710 align:middle
If you want to make money,
a different job would be quicker and easier,

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:36.080 align:middle
and the fans are always selfish, and you'll face
a barrage of criticism if you get a boyfriend.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.880 align:middle
Yeah, even so...

01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:42.250 align:middle
Mama sparkled.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.250 align:middle
Ruby will probably bounce back...

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.500 align:middle
In my several years living with her I came to understand
she's pure of heart, for better or worse.

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:52.830 align:middle
But I...

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.960 align:middle
have died once already anyway.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:58.920 align:middle
If Ai's not here, then this world...

01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:06.380 align:middle
That stalker and the man who
killed me are one in the same.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:09.790 align:middle
How did he pin down the hospital
Ai had been admitted to?

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.750 align:middle
Why'd he come to her new residence
she'd only just moved to?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:22.710 align:middle
The darkness of the man

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:22.710 align:middle
who killed Ai of B Komachi

01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:16.290 align:middle
The culprit was a student
without special skills of any kind.

01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.580 align:middle
I simply can't believe he'd be
capable of such detective work.

01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:22.210 align:middle
Someone was feeding him information.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.880 align:middle
And it must have been someone quite close to Ai.

01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:29.580 align:middle
As far as I know, it was only the president
who knew about her hospital.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.920 align:middle
But would he do such a thing to the public face of his
agency who he cherished so greatly?

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.330 align:middle
One of her co-workers?

01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:40.960 align:middle
No, the B Komachi girls weren't even that close, and
I never saw anyone who seemed like a good friend of Ai.

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:44.500 align:middle
It's evident Ai didn't have any relatives who were around,

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.830 align:middle
and it appeared she didn't know
their contact details either...

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:48.830 align:middle
So that only leaves...

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.880 align:middle
our father.

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:58.380 align:middle
She stubbornly kept him a secret from the president,
but considering the how narrow Ai's social circle was,

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.830 align:middle
there's a high probability the guy is in the same industry.

01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:04.250 align:middle
Seeing that he and I are related by blood,

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.080 align:middle
I can infer his identify by DNA testing his hair.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.710 align:middle
The guy who put Ai through all of that
is someone in the entertainment industry.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.580 align:middle
I can't die yet.

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:22.080 align:middle
Not until I find him and kill him by my own hand!

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:26.460 align:middle
Smoking Area

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.460 align:middle
Director.

01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:30.460 align:middle
Smoking Area

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.460 align:middle
Oh, Precocious...

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:36.460 align:middle
Well, at a time like this, I'm at a loss for what to say.

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.080 align:middle
You don't need to bother with that.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:41.830 align:middle
Instead, I'd like to ask a favor of you.

01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:43.040 align:middle
What is it?

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.330 align:middle
Would you consider raising me?

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:53.750 align:middle
Come on.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.330 align:middle
You're still not ready, Ruby?

01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.630 align:middle
Jeez, just wait a minute, Aqua.

01:18:58.630 --> 01:19:01.630 align:middle
This uniform might be cute, but it's pretty complicated.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.040 align:middle
But, it sure is cute!

01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:06.670 align:middle
Don't be making us late on the first day, okay?

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:09.920 align:middle
Isn't your skirt a bit too short?

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.830 align:middle
You know, you've always sounded like an old man.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.170 align:middle
Oh, that's right!

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.920 align:middle
Mom, we're heading out now.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:30.000 align:middle
And thus the prologue concludes,
and the curtain rises on a new tale...

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:36.920 align:middle
And now, I begin my revenge play.

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:12.750 align:middle
Is it recording now?

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:17.000 align:middle
Okay! I thought it would be nice to have this on video.

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:32.960 align:middle
Once you're grown up, it would be great if we're able
to watch this together while enjoying some alcohol.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:37.130 align:middle
Though, I highly doubt I'll still be an idol at that age.

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:41.540 align:middle
Oh, you two might be idols
yourselves by that point, though!

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.750 align:middle
I mean, you're my kids, so it could totally happen.

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:52.040 align:middle
In any case, please grow up healthy.

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:56.460 align:middle
As your mother, that is my sole wish.
