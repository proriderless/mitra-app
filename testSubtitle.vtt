00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.290 align:middle
Irumyuui...

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle
You know, until I met you,
there was something I'd been looking for.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.420 align:middle
This compass...

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle
The place this compass stands straight up...

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle
It's there.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle
The man who took me in when I had
no relatives to turn to was a terribly bad person.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle
He had this story - the one time in his life he
"played the leading role" - he'd boast about.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle
I remember it well because he made me
listen to that story every time IT happened.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle
One calm day, he went out to sea to fish...

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle
and came across a smoking ship out on the water.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle
A corpse that was still smoldering and spewing smoke
even though there weren't any flames.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle
A body that continued to writhe
despite being split in two.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle
Another whose insides had been expelled.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle
But deep inside the cabin, there was a single individual
who still looked like a person.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle
But he...

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle
was not in any condition to converse.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle
The hell's this?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle
It valuable or somethin'?

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle
That... c-compass...

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle
The place that compass... stands straight up...

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle
It's there.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle
A giant pit.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle
An extraordinary people-devouring one...
that stretches to... the bottom of the world.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle
I... I couldn't bear to look.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.420 align:middle
It's there. The Golden City is there...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle
inside the giant man-eating pit.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle
That's what he said.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle
Then the guy just died on us.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle
Hey, pretty nice, right?

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle
Hey, listen, I'm not like you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle
Got it?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle
Hey!

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle
I'm... not like you with that boastful story you clung to.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle
I prepared myself...

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle
for that one purpose...

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle
for that one purpose...

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle
for that one purpose...

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle
No...

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle
No, I had just longed for it.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle
To go to a place... where no one knew me.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle
Ya know, the Golden City...
They say it turns even junk into gold.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle
Even a used-up girl like you.
Even a worthless hunk of meat like this.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle
Think you'll turn to gold if I bring ya there?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle
To go to a place where that voice,
which still echoes even though he's gone, would vanish.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle
This is rough.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle
No matter how much I train,
I'll never get used to being seasick.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle
It's already been 20 days since the last port of call.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle
The fish we sometimes catch and the booze
that doesn't go bad are treats to us now.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle
Our leader, Wazukyan, is again today eating raw bugs
he caught down in the hold.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle
He says it prevents disease.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle
On top of all that, the horizon...

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle
disappears from sight,
only to engulf my vision a moment later.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.830 align:middle
Over and over again.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle
The only thing I have plenty of is nausea.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle
That's great.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle
It's not great at all.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle
You're gettin' used to the vomiting!

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle
Th-the precious food...

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle
Don't worry 'bout it!

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle
We still have another month's supply of hardtack.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle
Besides, we're almost there.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle
To the spot where the Star Compass
stands up straight...

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle
In these uncharted seas with crazy winds,
it's the only thing we can rely on.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle
Uh... Are you sure it's alright for m-me to hold onto it?

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle
Of course!

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle
You're one of the Three Sages of Ganja now.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle
When you brought that compass to me,
I felt it was destiny, you mmow?

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle
Seriously, you're our guidepost on this journey.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle
Don't you worry.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle
The things I believe in prove to be right.
We're almost there.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle
Like, for real.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle
See ya! I'm gonna go catch me some rats.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle
Don't mind him.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle
Belaf!

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle
It's not that he's insincere.
I think you know that...

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle
but sometimes he - and the rest of us too - just can't
put into words the truth that he physically senses.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle
And that's why he's usually like that.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle
We didn't take him seriously at first,
as we believed it was all in his head,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle
but he's the real deal.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle
You might say he's touched by the divine.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle
If you're ready to go, unload the cargo over there.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle
In his case, even supposing the Golden City
doesn't exist, he will find it.\NIf you're ready to go, unload the cargo over there.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle
He foretold that you'd join our group
and become one of the Three Sages.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle
That was the day before you appeared.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle
Such is the power of his gift.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle
Um, Belaf, is it really okay for me
to be one of the Three Sages?

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle
I... don't have any gifts like that.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle
Wh-what do you want me for?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle
I mean, I'm not worth trying to sell...
with this ugly body of mine.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle
The only thing I can do is take care of others.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle
What do you think beauty is?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle
Whuh?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle
Uh... Is it something like you, Belaf?
Full of confidence... and stuff?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle
I dunno.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle
A thing is not beautiful because it's beautiful.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle
It is not ugly because it's ugly.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle
Your eyes... sure are pretty.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle
That's right.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle
Beauty is in the eyes.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle
Got it?

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle
Not the eyes in a physical sense.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle
Take it to mean the look in the eyes.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle
Position, status, prestige, appearance...

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.630 align:middle
and even confidence
are not the true nature of beauty.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle
Even if your wounds fester unpleasantly,
even if you topple over in the face of injustice,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle
even if you are forced down when you try to stand,

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle
to continue to glare with affection and longing...

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle
That look in the eyes is the true nature of beauty.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle
You have dark eyes.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle
Fix your eyes upon the darkness.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle
For the light that no one else has found
exists only in true darkness.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle
Also, you are more capable and lovely than you think.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle
Very much so.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle
No matter how dirty or unsightly,
my eyes will not be deceived.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle
Remember that when that voice frightens you.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle
Vueko! Please come!

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle
Samashura has a fever!

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle
Whuh?! I-I'll be right there!

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle
Condescending as always, I see.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle
Outrageous!

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle
I was just trying to take a deeper look into things!

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle
How are the other ships?

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle
Jomi's and ours are the only ones left.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.670 align:middle
Wazukyan! Look!

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle
That cargo's from... Jomi's hold!

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.040 align:middle
I fear they've already...

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle
Belaf, Wazukyan, the compass...!

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle
Hey, over there!

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle
What is it?!

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle
A solitary island in an unnavigable patch of sea...

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle
That must be...!

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle
The Golden City of the Scorching Sun

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle
Anyone want to be first ashore?!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle
Alright! Boldly go forth!

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle
Finally, it begins!

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle
To our abandoned homeland!

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle
To our people! Let it echo far and wide!

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle
Yours are the feet that will crush injustice!

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle
It's really here.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle
That's...

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle
The Compass Pointed to the Darkness

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle
Wazukyan, these people...
weren't mentioned in our intel.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle
Whuh?!

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle
Huh?! What?!

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle
That's great. This is the real thrill of an adventure.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle
Ah, I see. What strange glyphs...

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle
Is this here "giant pit"?

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle
HADImaEN? madimo.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle
How's it going?

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle
Seems those who came before us
were violent and domineering.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle
They're reluctant to share information.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle
ADIII!

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle
What?

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle
Belaf, wh-what is that guy saying?

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle
KEFUie...

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.580 align:middle
Precious...

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle
KEFUiSORE...

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle
Precious thing...

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle
KORUSOMUgu...

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle
Form of the essential part?

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle
He says he's willing to help us
in exchange for the compass.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle
Here you are.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle
ADIII!

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle
Are you sure?

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle
You've kept your gaze on it for so long.
It's the yoke that guides you and your treasure.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle
It's... okay.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle
"The object of my gaze lies within the darkness."

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle
Oh?

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle
I-I want to go looking for it...

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle
That light that no one else has found.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle
It's so big.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle
A-are there really people living...

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle
...in a place like that?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle
The Golden City.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle
The natives called it "Shourou."

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle
And that means?

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle
"The Capital of the Unreturned."

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle
They also said, "You'll never be able to return,
but the Golden City exists."

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle
What's going on?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle
U-um... this kid... It seems she followed us.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle
Whuh?! What?!

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle
She's sniffing me like crazy!

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle
Excuse me a moment.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle
This tattoo...

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle
Hm? These wounds are still fresh.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle
"Baby... impossible."

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle
"As she cannot bear children,
she is exiled to the giant pit."

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle
That's roughly what it says.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle
How horrible...

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle
We don't have resources to spare
to be keeping her safe.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle
Sh-she's from here...
so she might know a lot about the pit.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle
Besides, um...

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle
Just look at her body! It's so supple!

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle
What's your call, Wazukyan?

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle
Hmm?

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle
We're in bad need of a guide.
One less thing to worry about.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle
Can't see the pit too good from here.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle
Alright, I'll go climb up.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle
What the...?!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle
What's this? Poison?!

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle
MAZYAsuma.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle
KUHOOmati.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle
MAZYAsuma! ZOOMU!

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle
Sorry, I don't understand.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle
MAJA. Hmm...

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle
"Giant pit...

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle
If you ascend in the interior, you'll be eaten," she says.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle
Hm? By what?

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle
"ZOOMU"...

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle
The closest translation would be... "curse."

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle
See?

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle
We really do need a guide, don't we?

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle
We're counting on ya!

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle
Now, let's go, shall we?! To the Golden City!

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle
It's not like I was feeling triumphant,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle
but my pulse was racing like it never had before.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle
We were "Ganja," the suicide squad
that set out for the Golden City...

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle
having been forsaken by our homelands
and people in general.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle
Believing in a nameless god,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle
we roamed searching for its source
in those who were not human.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle
Paranormal relics, otherworldly scenery,

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle
and the "Curse."

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle
Every one of them has...
all the mystery we'd been looking for.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle
All the intensity we'd been looking for.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle
Surely, even the source we were looking for
lay ahead of us, too.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle
Wow!

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle
I can see outside.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle
Yeah... and it's so quiet.
Hard to believe we're in the middle of a whirlpool.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle
This smell. I recognize it.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle
This's Eternal Fortune incense.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle
I see.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle
Cave raiders burn it for celebrations
and even funerals, don't they?

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle
It smells fresh.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.580 align:middle
I bet that bastard Bondrewd
lights some every once in a while.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.580 align:middle
Bondrewd... What was that guy's aim anyway?

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle
Who knows?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle
Doesn't seem like it was simply
going to the bottom of the netherworld, though.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.330 align:middle
He said something about
"the next two thousand years."

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.080 align:middle
Well... I sure don't feel like going back and askin' him.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle
That bastard's words are laced with poison.
No doubt anything he'd say would be self-serving.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle
Let's focus on what's next instead.
We've had enough of that poison, right?

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle
I just wanna be genuinely happy
about continuing on with you guys.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle
Nanachi...

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle
Well... it is annoying that he can
still peek in on my vision.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle
But, at least that's all he can do now.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle
Let's show him... our grand adventure!

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle
Nanachi!

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle
I'm glad to see you thinking positively!

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle
You... purposely snuck up on me, didn't you?!

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle
Don't sniff me!

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle
Damn him... He's picked up a strange skill!

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle
Th-this thing's...

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle
It's diving down?!

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle
Aww...

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle
I just rubbed Prushka a bit... and it started moving.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle
Adventures have a way
of suddenly getting started, you know?!

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle
R-Riko! Take your hands off the Prush-Stone!

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle
Wouldn't be very funny
if it started ascending instead.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle
Oops...

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle
Riko, Nanachi, that's...

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle
Even the letter didn't mention that thing.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle
You think maybe... it's a fish?

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle
What is this?

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle
Bones... and corpses that've been frozen stiff?

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.080 align:middle
"The Sea of Corpses"...

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle
I feel I've seen the truth of it now.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle
Yeah.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle
They say souls return to the bottom of the netherworld,
but it's as if they're told, "Leave your body here."

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle
To be honest, I didn't think we'd get this far.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle
I knew we would!

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle
Sure is taking a while to get there, huh?

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle
Yup.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle
It's been some time since we passed by
that layer of corpses.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle
About how many meters was it on the map?

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle
Hey, Riko! Come over here for a sec!

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle
Meinya's taking a dump in a part of the altar
that looks important.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle
Oh... how unrestrained...

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle
Will this saucer thing be alright soiled like this?

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle
Um, to tell the truth,
I don't think I'll be able to hold it either.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle
You mean pee?!

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle
Both...

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle
You can't hold it until we get outta this thing?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle
I dunno...

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle
Didn't we learn in class that many cave raiders
lose their lives while relieving themselves?

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle
Riko!

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle
There's no telling what awaits us in the sixth layer.
Just do it here!

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle
Luckily, there's still the smell of incense.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle
It's so quiet... you can hear it quite clearly.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle
Bondrewd, you watching this?
I actually feel pretty bad about it, you know.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle
We're exiting!

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle
The place the compass stands straight up... It's there.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle
The Golden City that everyone seeks,
longs for, and dreams of...

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle
Indeed, it really was there.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle
We arrived there at last...

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle
and then, we were never again
able to return from that place.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle
The Depths' Sixth Layer

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle
Capital of the Unreturned

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle
When the singing stops, it is the end of fate

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle
I had decided only that, I don't know the reason

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle
Although I'm yearning for it so much even the gold color fades

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle
It seems the outline of longing becomes more distant

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle
It overflows

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle
Here, my palm

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle
Squeeze it back

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle
Let's exchange pain for pain

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle
We'll turn it into provisions, pieces of fallen petals

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle
Wholly wounded, I imitate, I take shape

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle
Beyond the awakening

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle
Let's go, always, let's make it resound

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle
Next Episode

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle
Capital of the Unreturned
