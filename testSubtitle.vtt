WEBVTT

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.960 align:middle
Itch... Itchy, sosu.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle
sosu... Itchy, sosu...

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle
H-hey, Faputa?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.630 align:middle
Are you really, truly sure your wound is okay?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle
HADI...

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle
No need to worry, sosu.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle
Faputa is immortal, sosu.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle
Edge part is fine, sosu.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle
But, I don't think it's just an "edge."

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle
Reg, are you worried, sosu?

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle
Well, of course I am!

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle
Reg!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle
Pat me, sosu.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle
Like before, around the horns.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle
H-here?

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle
I'm not touching your wound, right?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle
Do it... a bit harder, sosu.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle
Hey, Faputa, why are you doing all this for me?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle
Hey... Um...

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle
Faputa?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle
GOOON.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle
shaZARAAFAbera ZOfuDIBEI.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle
RIE.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle
Beasts are going crazy over smell
of Faputa's blood, sosu.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle
GOOON.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle
maeN.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle
We'll leave that to Gaburoon and go, sosu.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle
Y-yeah.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle
Patting is precious, sosu...
But freshness is important, sosu.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle
maaa!

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle
Reg's back!

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle
Reg!

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle
I'm so glad you're okay!

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle
And, um...

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle
So, what's that?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle
I'd like to explain,
but this blood is attracting beasts.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle
Let's get inside.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle
Huh?

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle
Faputa?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.040 align:middle
Riko?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle
Okay!

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle
Come on, Meinya.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle
HADImae...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle
Ah...

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle
BANUfaso MUIIbusosu...

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle
You look very nice now...

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle
When the singing stops, it is the end of fate

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle
I had decided only that, I don't know the reason

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle
Although I'm yearning for it so much even the gold color fades

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle
It seems the outline of longing becomes more distant

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle
It overflows

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle
Here, my palm

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle
Squeeze it back

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle
Let's exchange pain for pain

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle
We'll turn it into provisions, pieces of fallen petals

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle
Wholly wounded, I imitate, I take shape

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle
Beyond the awakening

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle
Let's go, always, let's make it resound

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle
The Return

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle
Whuh?

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle
Is that... the Princess's?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle
I heard she was immortal, but...

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle
Huh? Is that, um... alright?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle
This is... that thing from the balancing!

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle
Similar, but strange!

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle
All IRUburu is crying out!

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle
A first for Kaja!

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle
Reg!

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle
It's gotta be because part of Faputa's here!

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle
Hey! What should I do with this?!

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle
Should we bring it to where Nanachi is?

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle
Wait...

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle
Whuh...

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle
Y-you can't just take it the way it is now.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle
The one who bought your friend...
Well, if you show that to him, I think...

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle
he'll probably break.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle
And if he does...

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle
I don't know what'll happen to your friend.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle
And, um... So, how did you get that?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle
So long as I keep my promise,
she said she'd give anything and offered this.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle
"Promise"? What kinda promise?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle
You want me... Me to destroy the village?!

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle
Faputa wants to but impossible, sosu.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle
You are kind, so can't do it, sosu.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle
sosu...

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.710 align:middle
So Faputa wants your help to get inside...

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle
Make it so Faputa can go inside Mother, sosu.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle
Reg, you said "comes out" of hand, sosu.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle
You said can "rewrite," sosu.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle
But you said couldn't use
because leaving to search for HAKU.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle
You said next time see Faputa,
will take me with you.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.130 align:middle
Take Faputa to where they are!

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle
To Mother...

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle
Hey...

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle
Want you to take me there, sosu.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle
Hold it! Why're you biting me?!

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle
Reg, you said if it can "rewrite,"

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle
you could do something about laws
not letting Faputa pass through.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle
The Incinerator!

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle
"It's powerful enough
to rewrite the rules of the netherworld."

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle
That's what Nanachi said!

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle
I-Inciner...?

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle
It comes out of Reg's hands!

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle
It can burn up anything!

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle
According to Faputa, my past self said,
"With this, it'd be possible to tear a hole in the wall."

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle
Well, I'll be!

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle
You were the Prince all along, huh?

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle
To think you actually brought back
a piece of the Princess!

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle
Seems the village's been thrown into chaos
by this value that shouldn't exist.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle
That looks good on you, Vueko.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle
But that thing on your head is actually underwear.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle
It's for villagers with lots of legs.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle
The shopkeeper said it could also be used as a hood.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle
So, you finally came out from there, huh?

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle
I'm so glad.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle
You already tell these kids about the Princess?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle
I did.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle
I centered the story on myself, though.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle
I see...

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle
Riko.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle
So, do you hate me now?

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle
I don't really know you...

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle
but I do like this village.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle
After all, there lots of others like me here -
even more than when I was in Orth.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle
Oh? And how're they like you?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle
Let's see...

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle
Um, Wazukyan, did you descend this far even knowing
you were going past the point of no return?

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle
Yeah.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle
I mean, that was the kinda trip we were on.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle
Oh, I see! That's what you're getting at!

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle
I heard from the Sovereign of Dawn.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle
You know him, right? Mr. Dawn.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle
He said that even among you "cave raiders,"
who make their living in this giant pit,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle
there's only a handful of humans who'll descend
to a depth it's impossible to return from.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle
And you're one of them!

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle
One who, while searching for their own gold,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle
found that the place where the darkness lies
is even more valuable.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle
One whose home is found
only in the continuation of their quest

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle
and who could only choose to push forward.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle
This place is a sanctuary for such types
who have nowhere left to go.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle
I'm sure there's not a single villager here
who'd call you reckless or foolish.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle
Well, yeah.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle
I've found heaps of value after
meeting my fate here, but, ya know...

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle
my days of challengin' the great pit
harken back to an unfulfillable longing.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle
There's hardly a day I don't dream of it.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle
HADI...

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle
Are you okay, Riko?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle
I wonder why...

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.790 align:middle
Um, uh... Wazukyan!

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle
I said I don't really know you,
but there is one thing I know!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle
No matter what you had to sacrifice or trample over,
you wanted your wish to come true.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle
This village - the creation of this homeland
for those with nowhere to go...

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle
I don't believe that was truly your wish.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle
If the Golden City you sought
really exists in the Abyss,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle
the depths' sixth layer is still just the entrance.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle
There's no way you, someone who
finds value in that extraordinary quest,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle
would choose to stop at the "entrance."

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle
Why are you pretending
you've given up on your adventure?

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle
I'm shocked!

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle
You're the first to notice in the roughly
150 years since the village's creation!

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle
Still, like the others I can't leave this village.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle
I can only live inside this place.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle
Things don't always work out, ya know?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle
Riko, what's wrong?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle
Faputa has the wish-granting power...

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle
of three Cradles of Desire.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle
The ones who can use the power
of the Cradles are...

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle
Um, Wazukyan, could it be that you want me
to use the power of the Cradles of Desire

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle
to make is so that the villagers
can go adventuring again?

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle
How'd you come to that conclusion?

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle
I've had something like that happen before.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle
Besides, I heard you're one of those guys
who "does everything he can."

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle
Impressive!

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle
That's great!

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle
Hey, boss... you're not gonna deny it?

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle
Challenging the Abyss once more...

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle
I've dreamed of that countless times,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle
but it's not somethin' you should just
burden someone with, ya know?

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle
It's not like that, Moogie.
I'm not the one who'll choose.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle
These kids will.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle
The choice can only be made by the challengers.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle
Is the ground rumbling?

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle
jimuNTSU modi KOBOO?

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle
What're they talking about?

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle
madimo.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle
Don't know

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle
adimomo jimuNTSUEPO

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle
They're speaking in the newcomers' language

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle
modiipoo.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle
What's that sound?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle
Now, Riko, Reg, what will you choose?

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle
That's...!

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle
Juroimoh!

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle
Yes, Juroimoh!

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle
Damn it! That bastard was just buying time?!

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle
Boy, that thing is after
that piece of the Princess...

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle
You're coming with me.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle
I'll lead it away!

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle
Riko! Head somewhere safe!

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle
Reg!

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle
Maaa, take care of Riko!

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle
maaaa!

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle
Yes! It's turning this way!

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle
It's not very fast! I can outrun it!

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle
Still, what should I do?

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle
What?! Something slimy is...

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle
Look, it's starting now.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle
Wh-why'd you grab me?

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle
Hm? 'Cause you're quick to give in to despair.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle
You just stay here and watch.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle
Th-there's something I want to know...
or, want c-confirmation on.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle
What is it?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle
That huge thing...

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle
Why does it have the same name
as the piece of trash who took me in?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle
Juroimoh?

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle
Irumyuui made him from signals she received from you,
someone special to her.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle
Irumyuui was lonely, you know.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle
After all, you just kept on brooding.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle
He just appeared one day
and said he was one of the Three Sages.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle
Whuh? It... can talk?

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle
When the village is in danger,
he comes out to obliterate the threat.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle
He's like this village's guardian, ya know?

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle
B-but if he snatches that piece of Faputa,
then even that scum...

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle
Um... he won't come out of the balancing
unscathed no matter how big he is.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle
I told ya - he's connected to you.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle
Rather than a Hollow,
he's more like a part of the village.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle
That thing is the will of this village.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle
What's... happening to it?

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle
The balancing?

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle
No, it looks like...

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle
It became one with... the slimy stuff?

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle
maaa!

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle
The entrance to the village!

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle
Nice one!

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle
You're not gonna let those kids escape, are ya?!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle
Something is... Oh no.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle
The wall is...

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle
The wall is getting buried.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle
Reg'll have nowhere left to run!

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle
What should I do?

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle
Faputa's the embodiment of value...

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle
If I let it snatch a bit of this,
will the balancing stop that thing?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle
That's great. He's wavering! Indecisive!

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle
Boy!

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle
That thing's creation stems back to me!
The balancing won't affect him!

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle
A piece of the Princess won't stop him!

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle
He has concluded you're a danger
and is trying to consume you guys!

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle
RUN!

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle
Vueko?

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle
Ru-!

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle
You okay?

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle
That's the first time I've seen you shout like that.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle
T-training my voice was the one thing...
I-I was able to do plenty of.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle
You told me to run, but where can I go?

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle
A thin, slimy...

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle
film?!

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle
Is he trying to cover the whole village?!

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle
This is looking bad!

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle
maaaa!

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle
Riko!

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle
Crap!

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle
He doesn't care if it gets the villagers?!

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle
S-stop it!

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle
Without that...

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle
Nanachi will...!

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle
I have to do it... don't I?

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle
Faputa will offer up her all
if it's for the promise, sosu.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle
I do like this village.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle
That village is my mother, who fell into despair
so deep she lost her speech, sosu...

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle
Mother's regret... her anger...

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle
Until those things are dispelled...

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle
I don't have the power
to change things all on my own.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle
There's no one behind him.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle
Damn it... Damn it all!

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle
It'd be so easy to shoot from this angle!

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle
Can doing this really change things for the better?!

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle
Well, at this point...

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle
now, there's no time to hesitate!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle
maaa...

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle
Reg!

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle
S-sorry.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle
I couldn't think of any other way.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle
Faputa is coming!

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle
She'll be here soon!

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle
I fear things are going to get really bad!

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle
Until I wake back up after fainting,
find somewhere as safe as you can to hide!

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle
Faint?

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle
I pass out for two hours
after firing the Incinerator!

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle
I have a few more minutes...

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle
but soon an inescapable drowsiness
will wash over me.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle
Can I offer you this to do me a favor?!

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle
Until I wake up, please keep Riko safe
inside the village!

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle
Outside is the Abyss' world
of the absolute boundary...

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle
I'm sure you know,
but it's far more dangerous than here.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle
Please!

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle
'Course we'll do what ya ask.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle
But that's a tall order for just us three.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle
Kaja get more help!

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle
I-Iru...

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle
Stand back.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle
You are in the presence of the Princess.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle
Reg.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle
You have my thanks, sosu.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle
Faputa will not forgive... you all.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.080 align:middle
My siblings... and Faputa...

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle
You glared at us with hungry eyes -
Faputa will not forgive those eyes.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle
Your mouths speak in the same tongue
my mother did and spit out prayers.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle
Faputa will not forgive those mouths.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle
Faputa will not forgive your forms.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle
You continually desecrated my mother
to selfishly save your own skins.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle
Faputa will not forgive your very lives,
which you have continued to live for so long.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle
Faputa will not forgive your intentions.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle
Your joy, your sorrow, your activities...
Faputa will not let any of that continue.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle
Faputa will never forgive your existence
until you turn to worthless dust.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle
Faputa was born so that all this will not be forgotten.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle
This day... this moment...

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle
You know not how Faputa has longed for it.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle
Faputa will allow you no time to prepares yourselves.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle
Faputa will eradicate you now.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle
GOOON.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle
Do not interfere, sosu.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle
O, brothers and sisters, your youngest sister
has returned home, sosu.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle
You did a good job supporting Mother.
You've done enough.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle
She's all healed...

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle
Th-the immortal Princess!

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle
What should Kaja do? So happy!

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle
And now, it begins.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle
A song?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle
Mitty... I was dreaming.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle
There was a guy who I was super dependent on.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle
I was going along with him on a search.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.210 align:middle
And then... What were we searching for again?

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle
Oh yeah. I thought they really resembled us.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle
Even though they didn't look like us at all.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle
And then, you know...

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle
After that... they finally found it:

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle
their treasure.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle
I wanted to keep... just keep on gazing.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle
Even if it was...

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle
Even if it was a dream, that's fine with me.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle
Hey... What?

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle
What's going on?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle
The time to awake has come.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle
Nanachi. It has come.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle
Starting now, it is no longer a dream.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle
