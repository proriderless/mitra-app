00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.250 align:middle
Mitty...

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.500 align:middle
Mitty...

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.250 align:middle
Mitty...

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 align:middle
Fluffy one,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle
what did you come here in search of?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle
The village is a closed cradle.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle
If one becomes its captive,
one's value shall transition,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle
one's longings will be fulfilled,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle
and in eternal peace one's journey will end.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle
When the singing stops, it is the end of fate

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle
I had decided only that, I don't know the reason

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle
Although I'm yearning for it so much even the gold color fades

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle
It seems the outline of longing becomes more distant

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle
It overflows

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle
Here, my palm

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle
Squeeze it back

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle
Let's exchange pain for pain

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.830 align:middle
We'll turn it into provisions, pieces of fallen petals

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle
Wholly wounded, I imitate, I take shape

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle
Beyond the awakening

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle
Let's go, always, let's make it resound

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle
Concealment

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle
I'm lost...

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle
Warped structures.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle
I can't rely on the amagiri
since there's none growing here.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle
And the depth gauge is beyond its range.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle
On top of that, I'm being chased by that tall thing.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle
Crap...

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle
I got too preoccupied with those flower petals.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle
If I could at least get back to where I was before...

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle
It's that lanky beast!

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle
A turbinid-dragon!

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle
If I recall correctly, they're quite "tenacious,"
but this one...

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle
Just how far is it gonna pursue me?!

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle
Damn! It really can read my movements!

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle
My arm got chipped?!

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle
Rocks and...

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle
what's this?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle
Eep!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle
Can't believe it puked that thing up!

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle
Didn't write anything about that, Lyza!

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle
It gave up?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle
Did I leave its territory?

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle
Damn it! Is there something I can grab?!

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle
Y-you...

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle
Were you trailing me?!

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle
GOOOOO.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle
My apologies, but I have to get back
to my companions.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle
I am grateful you saved me, though.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle
Other direction.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle
The place falls to ruin when you're around.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle
I removed you.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle
You...

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle
can talk?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle
Leave as soon as you can.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle
I cannot stop Faputa.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle
Nor can I stop that village.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle
What do you mean?

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle
If you can speak, then explain things clearly.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle
That is, the village lies not that way,
but in the other direction.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle
You sure this is the right way?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle
The beasts have been unusually active
for a while now.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle
There are no beast deterrents here.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.710 align:middle
"Beast deterrents"?

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle
The objects Faputa gave to your companions.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle
Charms made by mixing together body hair from Faputa
and the one to be protected within a "Beast of Omen."

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle
What?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle
You can't mean those super creepy things
we came across.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle
That's what those are?!

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle
Hey! Then was that note also from you two?!

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle
Faputa began to doubt that you were you,
so she tested you.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle
Upon reaching the Shourou Layer,
you made no attempt to search for her.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle
"Shourou"?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle
You must restore your missing data.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle
Hey, if you know, just tell me. What am I?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle
I do not know.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle
I have no data on Interference Units of your kind.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle
What? "Interference Units"?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle
I am an Interference Unit.
We observe and touch to gather knowledge.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle
Interference Units were placed in each layer,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle
but transmissions from the others
have ceased for quite some time.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle
They may have malfunctioned, or been taken.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle
Your design is similar to mine,
but Interference Units do not cross layers.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle
I wonder if we really share the same creator.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle
You know who this creator is?!

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.880 align:middle
I have not been granted that data.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle
You, who can go anywhere, please uncover said data.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle
It has come into view.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle
IRUBURU... the village.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle
Enjoying yourself?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle
Huh?!

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle
Uh... um, yes.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle
Good.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle
I'm glad.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle
HADI... delicious.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle
Although some of them might be a bit of a pain at times,
as you can see, they all mean well.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle
maaaa.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle
Um...

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle
Excuse me, what's the "Three Sages"?

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle
RIE... Sorry, my bad.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle
The Three Sages are the very important boss figures
who created this village, IRUburu.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle
Oh, my goodness!

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle
Sorry I haven't introduced myself! I'm Riko!

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle
A White Whistle...

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle
Ah, my white whistle's in someone
else's care right now.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle
I'm a cave raider!

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle
I see! That's great!

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle
Yay!

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle
See you later! manDAPPU!

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle
Doing well?

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle
That's great. FAmosu!

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle
Kind of smells like the sun...

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle
FAMO.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle
IE. IEkkuso!

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle
ma.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle
OU. You're still here?

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle
Um...

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle
I want to ask a favor of you.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle
OU?

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle
Can you teach me that language?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle
In our language, there are lots words
in which many actions and names are stuck together.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle
Take this one, for example.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle
JAKOpufu.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle
JAKOpu...

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle
It means 40 percent "to request,"
30 percent "special," and 30 percent "stimulus."

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle
Oh!

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle
And then this one is "IRUburu."

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle
Oh, that refers to this village, right?

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle
So you knew, huh?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle
Yes, it's 50 percent "village."

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle
As for the rest, it's 40 percent "cradle,"
and 10 percent "mother."

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle
"Village," "cradle," "mother"...

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.290 align:middle
Also, look here... This is "understood."

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle
KONbosu.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.420 align:middle
konbo...

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle
KONbosu.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.420 align:middle
"Thank you"... Ienme.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle
"Sorry"... Riezoochi.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle
Famo... "See you later."

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle
Rahossu. "I want you to do this for me." "Please."

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle
Oh...

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle
If you can remember all that,
the rest is a matter of practice.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle
Thank you very much!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle
Don't mention it. I had fun talking to ya.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.040 align:middle
Hope you find your friends.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle
Now I really wanna get my hands on a human child.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle
Oh, right!

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle
Do you have any idea where they might've gone?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle
Hm?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle
Hmm, let me think...

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle
At the edge of this village,
there's an area no one enters, you see.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle
Beyond even the sacrifice hole...

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle
there's a place called Doguupu, "within the eye."

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle
If we villagers go there, we get - How do I put it?

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle
We instinctively feel beaten down.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle
We're unable to go all the way inside.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle
But...

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle
since your friends aren't from the village,
it wouldn't be strange if they went in there to investigate.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle
After all, rumor has it the secret of the village
lies within Doguupu.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle
Exciting, ain't it?

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle
I can't see the fuzzy stuff even when I sniff Meinya.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle
Same as the village, seems there's no force field here.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle
What's this sticky stuff?

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle
Let's keep close to the wall for now.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle
ma!

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle
What is it?! What's the matter?!

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle
Those things from the balancing
are all over the ground.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle
They're moving, but they're not doing anything to us.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle
maaa...

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle
It's okay. Let's stay calm and keep going.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle
It's filled with tunnels.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle
Which one?

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle
Let's just start with this one.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle
maa...

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle
Kati...

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle
Sa... too...

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle
What?

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle
Ka... chi...

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle
Mai... e...

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle
maaaa...

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle
Sai... abu...

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle
ma.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle
You're not... a Hollow?

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle
HADI...

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle
Oh my, you still look like a human.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle
What?! Um...

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle
Oh, s-sorry, sorry!

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.210 align:middle
It's been so long since I've talked to anyone.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle
If I say something strange, uh, I... Sorry.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle
You're not a Hollow! A human in the sixth layer!

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle
Are you by chance a White Whistle?!

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle
Six... Hmm... White?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle
Ah, sorry.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle
I am Vueroeruko.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle
It's long, so they call me "Vueko."

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle
I'm... probably a human, I think.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle
Nowadays I name these little guys and sing and stuff,
since I have lots of free time.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle
Isn't that right, Kati?

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle
The sixth layer and
white whatchamacallit and all that...

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle
Don't know about 'em, sorry.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle
And you are?

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle
Why did you come to this sticky place?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle
My name's Riko!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle
And I'm looking for Reg and Nanachi!

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle
Reg?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle
Uh, um...

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle
How about...

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle
RAHOCCHU SOSU...

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle
Looking for

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle
JINSHIITSU...

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle
a robot and

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle
faffu.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle
a fluffy one

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle
No, what I mean is...

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle
Um, so are they your friends, those two?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle
Yes.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle
I can't find them anywhere,
so I wondered if they were here.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle
Ah, do you think that's what that was just now, Jeshii?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle
I got a signal, so I might know about one of them...
Their location, I mean.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle
Really?!

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle
I'd guide you there, but look...

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle
I can't take these off myself, you see.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle
If you just touched them while thinking "come off,"
that alone should be enough.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle
Are you... a bad person or something?

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle
This village...

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle
Its origins aren't very nice.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle
You could even say it's cursed.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle
And I myself... have something to do with that.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle
In Hell, everything gets so dulled...

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle
and we ended up being creators of Hell ourselves.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle
Even though there was nothing I could do about it...

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle
the creation of this village
was the one thing I opposed.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle
As a result, I got sealed away in this darkness.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle
But you know, through the signals,
I've watched over the village this whole time.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle
Although its origin is horrific...

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle
it's not such a bad place now.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle
The children who ended up distorted
at this gathering place of curses

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle
may have lost their human bodies,

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle
but their souls remain,
and they manage to keep carrying on.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle
What was I talking about again?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle
Oh yeah, I'm a bad person.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle
I was blinded by greed and
wanted to become something beyond human.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle
It's not simply that I came to such a place...

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle
I'm sorry.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle
Truth is, I don't care if you're a bad person.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle
Could you please take me to them?

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle
Once it's too late... that's it.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle
You're a really good kid, aren't you?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle
ma. maaa!

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle
Maaa?!

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle
A-are you okay?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle
Sorry about this.
It's all 'cause I asked you to come with me.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle
That child was chosen by you, weren't they?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle
Amazing...

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle
Being here should be an unrelenting agony
for children of the village.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle
Longing sometimes gets the better of instinct.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle
Right, Riko?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle
Well, let's get going.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle
This place must be pretty hard on that child, too.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle
Climb up there?

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle
N-no way!

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle
Impossible! There's no way!
My legs have grown so weak...

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle
maaa!

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle
You can do it!

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle
Amazing... So this is what it looks like now?

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle
I had no idea with only the signals to go on.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle
Um, do you happen to have something I could wear?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle
It'd be bad if someone spotted me.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle
Thanks! Fits perfectly.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle
For a while now, seems this place has been pretty lively.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle
Wonder what's going on...

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle
Ah, could it be...

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle
time for the Luring?

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle
"Luring"?

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle
I've never seen it before, either.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle
Maybe I'll watch later.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle
Look, here...

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.130 align:middle
This is Belaf of the Three Sages' house.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle
One of your friends should be here.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle
Um... Sorry, I can't go in there myself.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle
If they find out I escaped... HADI...

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle
It'd be bad.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle
Maybe you could go without me?

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle
You can wait here! I'll be fine!

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle
Besides, I have Maaa with me!

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle
maa!

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle
Belaf...

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.960 align:middle
Hello! Anybody home?!

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle
I'm coming in, okay?

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle
maaa...

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle
menMEE.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle
Whoops!

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle
Uh, I have some business with Belaf.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle
menMEE. menMEE.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.830 align:middle
Nanachi?!

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.830 align:middle
Excuse me, move aside, please!

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.170 align:middle
Nanachi!

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle
Wait, human child.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle
M-Majikaja?!

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle
Um, what in the world's going on?

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle
HADI... That is...

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle
BA-BANU... BANU famo, honDE.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle
A human child...

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle
Beautiful...

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle
BURUUsou. Hallo... I am Belaf.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle
What did you come in search of?

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle
Um, I came looking for Nanachi!

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle
And then Nanachi was here!

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle
Right, Nanachi?!

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle
That fluffy one... sold themself.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle
To buy Mitty from me, gave up themself.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle
I can't absorb Mitty anymore,
but fluffy Nanachi is here forever now.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle
Both are here forever... and happy.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle
RIEZOOCHI... Kaja...

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle
didn't know how precious Mitty is...

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle
and told Nanachi about this place.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle
Nanachi's eyes looked as though they saw HAKU...

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle
Mitty, who doesn't disappear no matter
how much you absorb her, is Belaf's favorite...

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle
by no means.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle
To Belaf, Mitty is something to always eat.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle
But...

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.830 align:middle
Please don't hurt Mitty anymore!
saying, "Please don't hurt Mitty anymore"...

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle
Nanachi sold themself...

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle
to buy Mitty.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle
Now... HAGUN...

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle
Nanachi has been put to sleep with smoke.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle
Whoa...

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle
Those eyes...

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle
You're the one who stayed with me back then.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle
I remember.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle
Thank you, Mitty.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle
Human child, you know Mitty?

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle
Yes.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle
She's someone very dear to Nanachi,
and she saved my life.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle
Um, so what do I have to do to get you
to give Nanachi and Mitty back?

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle
Mitty...

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle
Masked man brought with him.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle
Man...

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle
called himself "Sovereign of Dawn."

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle
On one of his many visits, Mitty was with him.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle
I knew by scent.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle
A real immortal.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle
With the signal of love as an intermediary,
a strongly crystalized Curse...

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle
In some sense, an incarnation of the netherworld.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle
I wanted her at any cost.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle
But, no matter what I offered,
he would not give her to me.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle
Huh? Then how?

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle
I paid compensation and had her born in IRUburu.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle
All of my 724 limbs.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle
Fifty percent of my body length.
A portion of my sensory organs.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle
I permanently reduced them
and used them as compensation.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle
A perfect reproduction of Mitty at that moment -
even the soul was copied.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle
And to obtain that,
Nanachi used all of themself as compensation.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle
What do you offer me?

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle
I don't know what I can give you yet.
I, uh, want you to tell me.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle
If you give your whole body, then immediately.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle
A negotiation! C'mon, think!

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle
Uh, you know...

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle
A whole human child
has unimaginable value in this place.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle
You're being too greedy.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle
My hair, which I've grown out a lot,
the nails from my left hand,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle
and all the equipment I have on me now...

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle
How does that sound?

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle
It's true I was too greedy.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle
So then...?!

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle
But, that is not enough.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle
In addition, I want you to choose one of the following.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle
Both eyes,

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle
or both legs,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle
or half your innards.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle
I won't go lower than that.
I want it, but I won't be greedy.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle
I will do all that I can so you don't die.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle
Human child,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle
I want you to choose.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle
I still remember you

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle
The time we shared

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle
The love you gave

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle
Though everything has changed
